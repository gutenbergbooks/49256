<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>On Tuesday in Easter week, 1912, accompanied by the
Rev. J. Khadder, Assistant Chaplain of St. Luke's
Mission, Haifa, I left that town for El-Kaisâriyeh
(Cæsarea), where we were entertained at the Orthodox
Greek rented house belonging to a Bosnian landlord. On
reaching Jaffa I secured a fresh carriage on April 12,
for Gaza, reaching that city in nine and a half hours,&mdash;an
unusually quick journey. During my visit of ten days
there I was the guest of the Rev. Dr. and Mrs. Sterling,
in the Church Missionary Society's compound. Nothing
could have exceeded their kind hospitality, and I am
greatly indebted to them for valuable local information.
Mrs. Sterling used her typewriter for producing my
Chapter XXI on the "History of the C.M.S. Gaza
Mission," 1878-1913.</p>

<p>The aged and scholarly German, Father Gatt, one of
the Latin Clergy attached to the Roman Catholic Patriarchate
of Jerusalem, who came to Gaza thirty-three
years ago from Austria, and ministers to eighty souls,
lent me three printed articles on Gaza, and cheerfully
added to my limited knowledge of the city. He mentioned
that a History of Gaza has been printed by Dr.
Martin A. Meyer, and published at New York in 1907,
but I had not the advantage of seeing this book. After
my manuscript was completed early in 1912, I procured a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
copy, and have during 1913 taken the liberty of incorporating
some additional information from its contents,
for which I am grateful.</p>

<p>Mr. A. A. Knesevich, H.B.M. Consular Agent at
Gaza&mdash;of Austrian parentage&mdash;lent me five of his official
printed Reports, notes from which are included under the
heading of "The Key of Syria," Chapter XIX.</p>

<p>It will be noticed in Chapter XVII that I am also
indebted to Mr. Emil G. Knesevich, for photographs of
an "Old Sarcophagus at Gaza," but unfortunately, they
have not proved sufficiently clear for reproduction.</p>

<p>Mr. Habeeb el-Khouri, the C.M.S. Catechist, not only
accompanied me to the Great Mosque, but supplied me
with information.</p>

<p>Miss Kate Sandreczka translated articles in German
bearing on the history of the city.</p>

<p>At a short distance from Mayoumas, the maritime
quarter of Gaza, on the north-west side, are the ruins
of Thedah (or Tedûn) the site of the ancient Hellenistic
town of Anthedon, lately discovered by Père Gatt.
Alexander Jannæus took it along with Gaza. In
company with Dr. Sterling I visited this spot, enveloped
in sand, on April 18, where we found broken pieces of
marble, ornamented glazed pottery, and ancient glass
scattered in every direction. Excavations for hewn
stone have not been infrequent here.</p>

<p>Augustus gave this port to Herod the Great, who
rebuilt it, and changed its name into that of Agrippeion,
after his friend Marcus Agrippa.</p>

<p>Anthedon was an early archiepiscopal see, in Palestina
Prima, and I am familiar with the few specimens of
its coinage during the reigns of Elagabalus (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 218-222),
and Alexander Severus (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 222-235). Since the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
of the Muslim occupation there is no mention of this
town, and its name does not appear in Holy Writ.</p>

<p>Among the Hellenistic towns in Schürer's <i>The Jewish
People in the Time of Jesus Christ</i>, Division II, vol. i,
pp. 72-3, there is additional information on Anthedon,
(Άνθηδών).<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>On the following afternoon I visited Djebel el-Mountâr,
a hill, two hundred and seventy feet high, about two miles
from the city towards the south-east. It is the "hill
that is before Hebron" (Judges xvi. 3) to which Samson
carried during the night one of the gates of the city. He
did not carry the gate as far as Hebron, which is upwards
of twelve hours' ride, but he went in the direction of
Hebron. It was a superhuman feat to tear away the
gate posts, and carry them across to the top of a
neighbouring hill.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare Josephus' account of
this episode with that of the sacred historian. In his
<i>Antiquities</i>, Book V, section 10, Whiston's edition,
the following passage occurs&mdash;</p>

<p>"Samson held the Philistines in contempt, and came
to Gaza, and took up his lodgings in a certain inn. When
the rulers of Gaza were informed of his coming hither,
they seized upon the gates, and placed men in ambush
about them, that he might not escape without being
perceived; but Samson, who was acquainted with their
contrivances against him, arose about midnight, and ran
by force upon the gates, with their posts and beams,
and the rest of their wooden furniture, and carried them
away on his shoulders, and bore them to the mountain
that is over Hebron, and there laid them down."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>The hill is covered with Muslim tombs, and over-topped
by a Weli, dedicated to Aly-el-Mountâr&mdash;"Aly
the Tower of Defence." Marnas was originally worshipped
here.</p>

<p>The extensive view well repays the ascent, for on a
clear day the mountains of Hebron may be seen. The
sea is visible. There is a fine view of Gaza, and the
extensive plain is under cultivation. Due south on the
coast is the site Deir el-Belah (Convent of Dates), where
the body of St. Hilarion was said to be finally buried.</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte camped here with his army one
night towards the end of February 1799, and on the
following morning continued his march towards Jaffa.</p>

<p>I gladly avail myself of this opportunity to express my
delight and astonishment at finding such an exceptionally
well managed native girls' school in the C.M.S.
compound. And no wonder, when Miss Smithies
instructs the four native female teachers, the two monitresses,
and the four half-monitresses, twice every
weekday! My experience is that the most useful boys'
school in Syria is at Sidon, under the American Congregationalists,
and Gaza may well be proud of its girls'
school, for there is nothing to approach its varied
excellence in Palestine.</p>

<p>The misgovernment of Gaza and its district is worse
under the Young Turks than under the late <i>régime</i>.
But the C.M.S. mission work in the Gaza compound is
indeed a bright spot in the city, and the persistent
Christian teaching&mdash;boldly proclaimed&mdash;is bearing fruit
in unexpected quarters. Holy enthusiasm is bound to
tell in the course of time.</p>

<p>It seems more common for the younger boys of the
poorer class in Gaza, than in other parts of Palestine, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
have their hair fancifully shaved. One has a tuft on the
top of the skull; another a small ring of hair. Some
small fellahin boys have the hair growing quite long
over the back of the neck, while the whole crown is well
shaved. The tuft of hair implies that Mohammed will
pull them into heaven. Another theory is that this tuft
is left for the benefit of the resurrection angel, who will
facilitate their resurrection from the grave.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that I have made free use of Dr.
George Adam Smith's <i>Historical Geography of the Holy
Land</i>, twelfth edition, 1906.</p>

<p>Mr. Miltiades N. Assimacopoulos, B.C., of Acre
(Ptolemais), has rendered me invaluable assistance in
looking up references, arranging the Index, and typewriting
portions of the manuscript for the press.</p>

<p>The indulgent reader will kindly remember that this
book has been compiled under peculiar circumstances.
There is no public reference library in this Muslim
town of Haifa, and the authorities who have been
consulted on Gaza are not agreed as to several dates in
its chequered history.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to the Rev. R. J. E. Boggis, B.D.,
St. Mary Magdalene's Vicarage, Barnstaple, for carefully
correcting the proof-sheets, as well as those of <i>The
Orthodox Greek Patriarchate of Jerusalem</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />
(I) OLD TESTAMENT, (II) DEUTERO-CANONICAL BOOKS,<br />
(III) NEW TESTAMENT REFERENCES TO GAZA
</h2>
</div>

<p>There are twenty <i>Old Testament</i> allusions to Gaza;
certainly one reference in the <i>Deutero-Canonical</i> books;
and one more in the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>.</p>

<p>1. Genesis x. 19.&mdash;<i>The border of the Canaanites was
from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza.</i> Thus
Gaza is among the earliest of the Canaanitish cities
mentioned in Genesis. The reference in this early
chapter, which transports us into the dim dawn of human
history, is a presumption of its extreme antiquity, and
like its distant neighbour Sidon suggests its being among
the most ancient cities of the world. Even before
Abraham left his fatherland Gaza stood on the southernmost
border of Canaan. Its important strategic position
on the frontier of Egypt has contributed to its long-continued
existence.</p>

<p>Gaza, like Damascus, is mentioned both in the <i>Book
of Genesis</i>, and in the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>.</p>

<p>2. Joshua x. 41.&mdash;<i>Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea
even unto Gaza.</i></p>

<p>Gaza became celebrated as one of the five royal cities
of the Philistines.</p>

<p>Politically, there were five <i>principal</i> centres: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
cities of Ashdod, Gaza, Askelon, Gath, and Ekron
(1 Sam. vi. 16, 17).</p>

<p>Unlike its neighbours Gath and Askelon, Gaza has
survived the various changes of history. Ashdod is now
the mud village of Esdûd. The modern name of Askelon
is 'Askalân.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The site of Gath is uncertain. Ekron is
identified with 'Akîr, near a station on the railway from
Jaffa to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>3. Joshua xi. 22.&mdash;<i>There were none of the Anakims
left in the land of the children of Israel; only in Gaza,
in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</i></p>

<p>Joshua only partially subdued this remarkable people,
who seem to have been akin to the Rephaim and other
gigantic races alluded to in the Old Testament. It was
not contemplated that, under any circumstances, the
"dispossession" alluded to in Numb. xxxiii. 51-3,
would be <i>at once</i> completed, as plainly intimated in
Exodus xxiii. 29, 30.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>4. Joshua xv. 20 and 47.&mdash;<i>This is the inheritance of
the tribe of Judah ... Gaza with her towns and her
villages.</i></p>

<p>Although the tribe of Judah, to whom the city fell,
subdued it, yet they appear to have held it but a short
time.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>5. Judges i. 18.&mdash;<i>Judah took Gaza with the coast
thereof.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>This victory of Judah <i>alone</i> over the chief cities of
Palestine is a proof that the subsequent oppression of
Israel by the Philistines was due to the sins of Israel.
The five lords of the Philistines not only regained
possession of their own territory, but also increased in
strength, and, at length, extended their jurisdiction in
turn over the Israelites (Judges iii. 1-5).</p>

<p>"The Philistines appear to have come into the maritime
plain of Syria either shortly before or shortly after Israel
left Egypt."&mdash;<i>G. A. Smith.</i></p>

<p>6. Judges vi. 3-5.&mdash;<i>When Israel had sown, the
Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children
of the east, ... and they encamped against them ... till
thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for
Israel.</i></p>

<p>A new apostasy, punished by the oppression of
Midian, is here introduced. This invasion came from the
south-east and extended over the whole land "unto
Gaza" in the south-west.</p>

<p>7. Judges xvi. 1-4.&mdash;<i>Then went Samson to Gaza.</i></p>

<p>8. Judges xvi. 21-31.&mdash;<i>The Philistines took him, and
put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza.</i></p>

<p>Gaza had been the scene of Samson's sin (verses 1 and
2). It is now made the scene of his punishment.</p>

<p>After forty years of oppression, Samson appeared as
the champion and avenger of his people. The tragic
close of his life has given Gaza an imperishable fame.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Samson hath quit himself</span><br />
Like Samson, and heroically has finished<br />
A life heroic."&mdash;<i>Milton.</i><br />
</div>

<p>The famous Dagon, or the "Fish-god," who had a
temple at Gaza (Judges xvi. 21-5), was a national, and
not merely a local god among the Philistines. During
the Maccabean wars Jonathan destroyed the temple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Dagon at Azotus (1 Macc. x. 84). He was eminently
the god of agriculture.</p>

<p>9. 1 Samuel vi. 17.&mdash;<i>The golden emerods which the
Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> ... for
Gaza one.</i></p>

<p>During the "seven months" the sacred chest was, no
doubt, located in each of the five Philistine cities, in the
Dagon temple, which each of the cities possessed.</p>

<p>The god Dagon was worshipped at Gaza and Ashdod,
and the goddess Derketo at Askelon. It has been assumed
that the two divinities were akin. According to
Lucian, Derketo was worshipped under the form of a
woman with the body and tail of a fish, fish being sacred
to her, and was probably identical with Atargatis, in
2 Macc. xii. 26. Hence Dagon was supposed to have
been the male counterpart of Derketo. This view,
however, Prof. Sayce now repudiates, preferring to
regard Dagon as a purely agricultural deity.</p>

<p>10. 2 Kings xviii. 8.&mdash;<i>Hezekiah smote the Philistines,
even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof.</i></p>

<p>The entire land of Philistia was ravaged by the Judæan
forces.</p>

<p>After continual wars under the Judges, with Saul
(1 Sam. xiv. 52, xxxi. 1), and David (2 Sam. v. 17-25),
the Philistines appear to have been subdued by the latter,
and Gaza became the border of Solomon's kingdom "on
this side of the river" (1 Kings iv. 21, 24). In verse 24
Azzah, or rather ‘Azza, is the more correct spelling of
Gaza. There is a reference to Gaza under the name of
Azzah in Deut. ii. 23, and 1 Chron. vii. 28 (R.V.). With
this exception the R.V. adopts the reading Gaza.</p>

<p>In Joshua xv. 47 "the river of Egypt" (A.V.) refers to
the desert stream, one mile wide, which still occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
flows in the valley called El Arîsh, twelve hours' ride
south of Gaza. Palm trees are abundant in the bed of
this torrent. See Gen. xv. 18; Joshua xv. 4; 1 Kings
viii. 65; Is. xxvii. 12.</p>

<p>11. 1 Chronicles vii. 28.&mdash;<i>And their possessions were
... unto Gaza and the towns thereof.</i></p>

<p>The passage refers to Ephraim's habitations, but this
is a doubtful reading. The Revised Version of the Old
Testament reads <i>Azza</i>, in the margin <i>Ayyah</i>.</p>

<p>12. Jeremiah xxv. 17-20.&mdash;<i>Then took I the cup at the
<span class="smcap">Lord's</span> hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto
whom the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had sent me: to wit ... all the kings
of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah,
and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod.</i></p>

<p>The words describe the act of the prophet as in the
ecstasy of vision. One by one the nations are made to
drink of the cup of the wrath of Jehovah. Among them
are four of the cities of the Philistines, including Gaza.</p>

<p>13. Jeremiah xlvii. 1.&mdash;<i>The word of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that
came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines,
before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.</i></p>

<p>This passage probably refers to Pharaoh Necho II's
(610-594 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) first advance to Carchemish in 609 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
Having defeated and killed Josiah, King of Judah, at
Megiddo, he advanced to the Euphrates, and on his
return smote the city of Kadytis which is probably Gaza.</p>

<p>14. Jeremiah xlvii. 5.&mdash;<i>Baldness is come upon Gaza.</i></p>

<p>The reference is to the destruction which Nebuchadrezzar
inflicted upon the whole Syrian seaboard from
Sidon to Gaza after Pharaoh Necho's defeat at
Carchemish in 604 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (Jeremiah xlvi. 2).</p>

<p>Gaza had to recognise the supremacy of Babylon.
"Baldness" is the sign of mourning (Micah i. 16).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Destroyed again and again, its situation has always
secured its being rebuilt.</p>

<p>15. Amos i. 6, 7.&mdash;<i>Thus saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; for three
transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn
away the punishment thereof; because they carried away
the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom: but I
will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour
the palaces thereof.</i></p>

<p>The proceedings of Philistia against Judah are here
represented by Gaza as the principal city. See 2 Chron.
xxi. 16-17, which implies a veritable sack of Jerusalem.
The extreme barbarity of which Judah complained was
that her children were delivered up to her old implacable
enemy, Edom.</p>

<p>16. Zephaniah ii. 4.&mdash;<i>Gaza shall be forsaken ...
and Ekron shall be rooted up.</i></p>

<p>There is a play on the meaning of these words, "Gaza
(Azzah = strong) shall be forsaken (âzab)" and "Ekron
(deep-rooting) shall be rooted up (âkar)," similar to that
in Micah i. 10, <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>The chastisement of Philistia is prophesied in verses
4-7. "The fulfilment of the prophecy is not tied down
to time" (Pusey, <i>Minor Prophets</i>).</p>

<p>17. Zechariah ix. 5.&mdash;<i>Gaza shall see it, and be
very sorrowful.... The king shall perish from
Gaza.</i></p>

<p>Well might Gaza fear and tremble on hearing of the
destruction of Tyre.</p>

<p>Gaza was taken by Alexander the Great after a siege
of two months.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> When he subdued it, he ordered all the
men to be slaughtered without quarter, and carried away
all the women and children into bondage, 332 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> New
colonists settled within the city, which now ceased to be
a Philistine centre, only to become a Greek one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>Gaza must have been at this time a city of great
strength, for Alexander's Greek engineers acknowledged
their inability to invent engines of sufficient power to
batter its massive walls. Alexander himself was severely
wounded in the shoulder during a sortie of this garrison.</p>

<p>Special mention is made by Hegasias (a contemporary
of Alexander) of the "King" of Gaza being brought
alive to Alexander after the captivity of the city. The
name of the governor of the garrison at Gaza was
Babemeses.</p>

<p>In Pusey's <i>Commentary on the Minor Prophets</i>&mdash;Amos
i. 6, 7; Zephaniah ii. 4; Zechariah ix. 5, there is
much additional information concerning the prophecies
against Gaza.</p>

<p>Gaza is there described as first Canaanite; then
Philistine; then, at least after Alexander, Edomite; after
Alexander Jannæus, Greek; conquered by Abu-Bekr the
first Khalif, it became Mohammedan; it was desolated
in their civil wars until the crusaders rebuilt its fort;
then again Mohammedan.</p>

<p>1. 1 Maccabees xi. 61, 62.&mdash;<i>From whence he</i>
[Jonathan] <i>went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out;
wherefore he laid siege unto it, and burned the suburbs
thereof with fire, and spoiled them. Afterward, when
they of Gaza made supplication unto Jonathan, he made
peace with them, and took the sons of their chief men
for hostages.</i></p>

<p>After the death of Alexander, the territory of Gaza
became for two centuries the battlefield between the
Egyptian, Syrian, and Jewish armies. Twice (315 and
306 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) Antigonus took the city from Ptolemy I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
The latter re-took it twice at the point of the sword, and
for a century it remained under the power of Egypt.</p>

<p>The Syrians again devastated it in 198 <span class="smcap">B.C</span>.</p>

<p>Jonathan Maccabeus (the wary), the Jewish leader
and high priest (161-143 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) laid siege to its suburbs,
and forced the inhabitants to sue for terms (1 Macc. xi.
61, 62).</p>

<p>2. 1 Maccabees xiii. 43-8.&mdash;<i>In those days Simon
camped against Gaza,</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> <i>and besieged it round about; he
made also an engine of war, and set it by the city,</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> <i>and
battered a certain tower, and took it.</i></p>

<p>Simon the Maccabee, Ethnarch, and High Priest,
142-135 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, laid siege to the fortress of Gaza, and
expelled the heathen inhabitants. Shortly afterwards he
appointed his third son, John Hyrcanus I, as commander-in-chief
of all his forces.</p>

<p>1. Acts viii. 26.&mdash;<i>And the angel of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> spake
unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto
the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,
which is desert.</i></p>

<p>There is only one New Testament reference to Gaza,
and it has given rise to much controversy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The pronoun αὕτη may either relate to ὁδὸν (way) or
to Gaza. If the former, then it is the <i>way</i> which is
desert; if the latter, it is the <i>city</i>. If we apply it to the
city it is difficult to reconcile the statement with the facts
of history; unless we regard the phrase "which is desert"
as a parenthetic explanation of St. Luke's written soon
after the destruction of Gaza by the Jews in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 66.</p>

<p>Some refer ἔρημος to the <i>ancient city</i> destroyed by
Alexander, and affirm that the new city occupied a
different site.</p>

<p>The words αὕτη ἐστὶν ἔρημος, however, were probably
intended to describe the Roman highway on which St.
Philip the Evangelist should find the Eunuch. There
were then, as now, several roads leading from Jerusalem
to Gaza. Two traversed the rich plain of Philistia; but
one ran to Eleutheropolis (Beit Jibrîn), and thence direct
through an uninhabited waste to Gaza.</p>

<p>See Alford's <i>Greek Testament</i> on Acts viii. 26, and
Wordsworth's <i>Greek Testament</i> on the same passage,
which he thus explains: "Go by the road which leads
to Gaza&mdash;which is desert; Almighty <span class="smcap">God</span> has something
for thee to do there. He can enable thee to do the work
of an Evangelist, not only in the city of Samaria, but
in the wilderness of Philistia."</p>

<p>Note on Acts viii. 38.&mdash;Deacons in the early Church,
notwithstanding the precedent of St. Philip, were not
usually allowed to baptise alone. Wordsworth's <i>The
Ministry of Grace</i>, p. 161.</p>

SUMMARY OF CHIEF EVENTS RELATING TO GAZA<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> FROM
1503 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1913</h2>
</div>

<h3><i>Section</i> I (1503 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to 30 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>)<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></h3>

<p>1503-1449 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Eighteenth Dynasty. In the twenty-second
year of his reign, 1481 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (according to Sayce),
Thothmes III made his first determined attempt to
subdue Canaan. Gaza was occupied with much difficulty.
The fortress of the Prince of Gaza is mentioned in the
great expedition of Thothmes III.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 1444 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Eighteenth Dynasty. Amen-hetep II,
successor of Thothmes III, has hieroglyphic inscriptions
in Gaza, which have been lately discovered. They show
that a temple had been built by this Egyptian king to
the goddess An Mut.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 1366 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Nineteenth Dynasty. Seti Mer-en Ptah
I, the father of Rameses II, drove the Beduins before
him from the frontiers of Egypt to those of Canaan, and
established a line of fortresses and walls along "the way
of the Philistines," which ran by the way of the shore to
Gaza (Sayce).</p>

<p>1348-1281 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Nineteenth Dynasty. Rameses II,
User-Maāt-Ra (the Great), continued to hold Gaza till at
least 1292, or later.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 1225 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Twentieth Dynasty. Rameses III, Hik-An,
captured Gaza, but it does not seem to have remained
long in the possession of the Egyptians (Sayce).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>734-732 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Tiglath-pileser III, the founder of the
second Assyrian Empire, plundered Gaza, and made it
subject to Assyria. It soon revolted against its new
masters, relying, no doubt, upon help from Egypt, but
in vain.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> 720 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Hanno, King of Gaza, called to his aid
So (Shabaka), King of Egypt (2 Kings xvii. 4), against
the Assyrian general Sargon, and commenced that
gigantic struggle between Asia and Egypt, of which Gaza
was the centre. Sargon chastised the rebels. In 715 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
Rabshakeh (the title of the officer sent by Sennacherib)
reproached Hezekiah: "Thou trustest upon the staff
of this bruised reed, upon Egypt; whereupon if a man
lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: So is
Pharaoh King of Egypt unto all that trust on him"
(2 Kings xviii. 21).</p>

<p>701 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Gaza remained subject to Sennacherib, the
Assyrian king. Sennacherib died in 681 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Tirhakah,
the last king but one of the twenty-fifth (Ethiopian)
dynasty, began to reign in 691 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (2 Kings xix. 9).</p>

<p>674 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Esar-haddon, son of Sennacherib, one of
the greatest Assyrian kings, retained Gaza (2 Kings
xix. 37).</p>

<p>662 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;One of Asshûr-bani-pal, King of Assyria's
expeditions enveloped the east coast of the Mediterranean,
including Gaza, which rendered him submission.</p>

<p>609 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Pharaoh Necho II took Gaza by force
after the fall of the Empire of the Sargonides (Jeremiah
xlvii. 1).</p>

<p>The Hellenistic population after this period became
more numerous.</p>

<p>"The eight days' march across the sands from the
Delta requires that, if an army came up that way into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Syria, Gaza, being their first relief from the desert, should
be in friendly hands. Hence the continual efforts of
Egypt to hold the town."&mdash;<i>G. A. Smith.</i></p>

<p>624-596 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;After some three generations of the
dominion of Babylonia, Egypt once more spread its
power. The sturdy Psamtek I (Psammetichus, "the
lion's son") had, from 624-596, held the south of
Palestine, including Gaza.</p>

<p>529 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Cambyses (Ahasuerus) King of Persians and
Medes, after the fall of Babylon, set out for the conquest
of Egypt. Gaza alone dared to resist him, and was not
subdued till after a very long siege. There seems, however,
to be considerable doubt as to Cambyses, the son
of Cyrus. Xerxes is certainly the Ahasuerus of Ezra
iv. 6, and of the Book of Esther.</p>

<p>332 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;"Gaza was strong enough to resist for two
months a siege of Alexander the Great, during which
he was wounded. It was ultimately taken by storm,
but not entirely destroyed. Bates, the Persian, who
defended the city against Alexander, employed Arab
mercenaries."&mdash;<i>G. A. Smith.</i></p>

<p>All the maritime towns, save Tyre and Gaza, appear to
have welcomed Alexander the Great and accepted his
policy.</p>

<p>Gaza, next to Tyre, was the most important fortress
in the Philistinian-Phœnician coast. Plutarch (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
66), telling the story of its siege by Alexander, calls it
"the biggest city of Syria."</p>

<p>After this siege, Gaza became more and more a Greek
centre. New colonists settled within the city, which
ceased to be a Philistine centre. Josephus expressly
designated it a πόλις Ἑλληνίς.</p>

<p>315 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Gaza was conquered by Antigonus, King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Asia, having been wrested from Ptolemy I, Soter, of
Egypt (323-285), who had seized Philistia and garrisoned
Gaza in 320 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>312 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;The city fell again into the hands of
Ptolemy I, in consequence of his victory over Demetrius,
the son of Antigonus.</p>

<p>In the same year, however, he renounced the possession
of Cœle-Syria, and on his retreat had the most
important fortresses, Gaza among them, demolished.</p>

<p>240 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;The sovereignty over these districts changed
several times during the decades next following, till at
length they were for a longer period in the possession of
the Ptolemies.</p>

<p>218-217 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Gaza, like the rest of Syria, was
temporarily in the possession of Antiochus III (the
Great). He is mentioned in 1 Macc. viii. 6-8. Becoming
engaged in a quarrel with Egypt, he made four successive
expeditions from Antioch to that country, in each
case passing down the coast of Syria, inflicting misery on
its inhabitants.</p>

<p>198 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Cœle-Syria came permanently under the
dominion of the Seleucidæ, through the victory of
Antiochus the Great at Panias. Gaza was conquered
after a difficult siege.</p>

<p>The sway of the Seleucidæ is evidenced by a silver
coin of Demetrius I, Soter, 162-150 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, minted at
Gaza.</p>

<p>161-143 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;During the leadership and high-priesthood
of Jonathan "the wary" (who sided with Antiochus
VI, son of Alexander Balas, against the faithlessness of
Demetrius I), he lost no time in bringing the entire
territory between Gaza and Damascus into subjection,
with the assistance of Jewish and Syrian troops. Jonathan's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
history is one of constant intrigue, and his
successes were due to craft and duplicity, rather than to
valour and wisdom.</p>

<p>Gaza only yielded after Jonathan had recourse to
forcible measures. He compelled the citizens to give
hostages, and took them with him to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Gaza at this time had a Council of 500 members.</p>

<p>141 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Gaza, the last of the Philistine towns not
conquered by the Jews, was taken by Simon III,
Ethnarch and High Priest. He is described in 1
Maccabees ii. 65, as "A man of counsel." A beautiful
picture of him is to be found in 1 Maccabees xiv. 4-16.</p>

<p>96 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Gaza fell into the hands of King Alexander
Jannæus, the third son of Hyrcanus, high priest, and a
prince of the Maccabean line. He took the city after a
year's siege, though at last only through treachery. He
gave the inhabitants up to the sword, and entirely
demolished the city.</p>

<p>"It was not till 96 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> that Jews actually crossed her
walls, but in that year the pent-up hatred of centuries
burst in devastation upon her."&mdash;<i>G. A. Smith.</i></p>

<p>65 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;When Pompey the Great conquered Syria,
Gaza obtained her freedom. He arranged that the Roman
general, A. Gabinius, Governor of Syria, should divide
Judæa into five parts. Gabinius rebuilt Gaza 57 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
which was once more securely inhabited, and allowed it
to resume its ancient prosperity under the power of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The newly built "maritime" and free city began a "new
era" from the time of Pompey. According to some few
authorities the ancient city was then forsaken, and the
new town built somewhat farther southwards, possibly
close to its harbour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>30 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>&mdash;Augustus, when in Egypt, handed Gaza over
to King Herod I, of Philistine origin, who placed over
this "maritime city" his brother-in-law, the Idumean
Costobar. In favour of his <i>Ascalon</i> descent are certain
allusions of Herod I to that city. At the death of Herod
the Great, Gaza, still called a "maritime city," was
annexed once more by Augustus to the province of Syria.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Two of the passes through the Judæan and the Samaritan
hills were strongly fortified by Herod I, who also held
the tolls at Gaza, for Arabia by Petra and for Egypt.
Gaza is the outpost of Africa, and the door of Asia.</p>


<h3><i>Section</i> II (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 41-1913)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 41-54.&mdash;During the reign of Claudius, Gaza is
spoken of as an important city by the Spanish geographer
Pomponius Mela, with whom agree Eusebius and
St. Jerome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> <span class="smcap">66.</span>&mdash;During the government of the fourteenth
and last Judæan Procurator, Gessius Florus, Gaza was
burned by the rebellious Jews. This destruction could
have been but temporary, for there exist coins of Gaza,
struck in honour of Vespasian and following emperors,
which show that the city was still a place of importance
soon after the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The independence of the city is proved by the fact that
Gaza had then its own independent kalendar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 129-130.&mdash;Special tokens of favour were bestowed
upon Gaza by Hadrian. The twenty-two coins
of Gaza (the new era), as described in detail by De
Saulcy, <i>Numismatique de la Palestine</i>, pp. 215-18, refer
to Hadrian's residence within the city. Dr. Coles, of
Haifa, possesses a large number of Hadrian's Gaza
coins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the second and third centuries Gaza became a
prosperous centre of Greek commerce and culture. Her
schools were good, but her temples were famous, circling
round the Marneion.... The schools of Gaza in
philosophy and rhetoric grew more and more distinguished.
Students, it is said, left Athens to learn the Attic style
in Philistia, and even Persia borrowed her teachers."
&mdash;<i>G. A. Smith.</i></p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 300-371.&mdash;St. Hilarion, the first hermit of
Palestine, was born at Thabatha, five miles from Gaza.
(The reader is referred to Chapter IX for the Life of St.
Hilarion.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 307.&mdash;Copies of the Holy Scriptures had escaped
their general destruction under Diocletian's Edict, and
were still in use at Gaza when persecution raged there in
this year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 308.&mdash;St. Sylvanus, Bishop of Gaza, and others
were martyred on May 4, during the persecution of
Maximianus I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 330.&mdash;Asclepas, Bishop of Gaza, who was accused
of being "secretly tainted with Arianism," was deserted
by the majority of the devout clergy and laity, and
deposed, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 341, but afterwards he received full acquittal.</p>

<p>Asclepas was present at the first Œcumenical Council
of Nicæa, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 325.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 335.&mdash;Constantine the Great rewarded the
inhabitants of Mayoumas, the port of Gaza, for their
unanimous adoption of Christianity, by erecting their
town into "the city of Constantia" (Κωνστάντεια). It
seems that this emperor, finding the inland city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
authorities obdurately pagan, gave a separate Constitution
to its sea-town, but Julian (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 361-363) took these
privileges away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 361.&mdash;At Mayoumas, the port of Gaza, the whole
population was enthusiastically devoted to the Christian
Faith, whereas Gaza was remarkable for its intense
hatred.</p>

<p>Julian the Apostate's accession, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 361, was the
signal for an intensified persecution. He made Constantia
again tributary to Gaza, but on his death its independence
was restored.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 386.&mdash;St. Jerome and St. Paula, as early Christian
pilgrims, after travelling among the Egyptian
hermits, visited Gaza before returning to Bethlehem.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 401.&mdash;Eight heathen temples were destroyed
through the influence of the Empress Eudoxia. As late
as the fourth century an idol named Marnas was
worshipped in the city.</p>

<p>In the Roman Imperial period commencing 27 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
the chief deity of the city was Marnas, Lord of heaven
and sun and moon, as his name (מר = Lord) implies.
He was originally a Shemitic deity, being, however,
more or less disguised in a Greek garment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 406.&mdash;On Easter Day St. Porphyrius consecrated
the Church of Gaza, named after the Empress Eudoxia.</p>

<p>St. Porphyrius, a Greek ecclesiastic, after living five
years as a hermit in the Thebaid of Egypt, went with his
disciple Marcus to Jerusalem, and finally became Bishop
of Gaza.</p>

<p>(For further particulars about St. Porphyrius, see
Chapter VII.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 541.&mdash;At the Council of Gaza, Pelagius (the first
Pope of that name, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 555-560) then a deacon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Roman Legate at Constantinople, was sent by order of
the Emperor Justinian I (the Great) with letters, ordering
the deposition of Paul,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the twenty-ninth Patriarch of
Alexandria, which was accordingly carried out. This
local Council was attended by Ephraim, Patriarch of
Antioch, Peter, Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Metropolitan
of Ephesus, and some other Prelates. Zoilus
succeeded Paul in the Throne of St. Mark.</p>

<p>The story of the fall of Paul is involved in much confusion.
He was consecrated by St. Menas, Patriarch of
Constantinople, this being the first instance of an
Alexandrian Patriarch being consecrated from the Throne
of Constantinople. He held his see for about two years,
from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 539-541.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 635.&mdash;Gaza fell into the hands of Abu-Bekr, the
general of the first Khalif, Omar, after a decisive battle
with the Byzantine army. It was one of the first points
of attack during this invasion, and about this date the
city became Muslim.</p>

<p>The city was regarded as an important place by the
Muslims, because Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, Mohammed's
grandfather was buried there. About this date we hear
little more of Muslim Gaza, except as its being the
birthplace of Mohammed ibn Idris ash-Shâfiy, the
founder of a Muslim sect, and the Great Doctor of the
Law.</p>

<p>About the end of the sixth century, or the beginning of
the seventh, Robinson (<i>Biblical Researches in Palestine</i>,
vol. ii, p. 42) states that "Gaza was visited by
Antoninus Martyr, who describes it as splendid and
delicious; and its inhabitants as noble, liberal, and
friendly to strangers."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 672.&mdash;Gaza was visited by a great earthquake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 796.&mdash;The city was laid waste during a furious
civil war among the various Arab tribes inhabiting the
country.</p>

<p>During the many wars between the Muslim rulers of
Egypt and Syria, which preceded the Crusades, Gaza
again suffered greatly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 867.&mdash;Bernard the Wise&mdash;a Breton monk&mdash;describes
Gaza as "very rich in all things."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1149.&mdash;Baldwin III built a fortress at Gaza, in
order to cut off the approach to Ascalon from the south.</p>

<p>The defence of the castle was entrusted to the Knights
Templars.</p>

<p>The great buildings of Palestine are not to be ascribed
to the Jews (for they were not a great building people),
but to the Byzantine and Crusading Christian epochs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1170.&mdash;The Crusading castle at Dârûm (Deir el
Belâh), three hours south of Gaza, was unsuccessfully
stormed by Saladin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1170.&mdash;On December 20, Saladin made a dash
on Gaza, but did not get possession of the citadel. He
entered the city, and killed several of the inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1177.&mdash;-At this date there were many Knights
Templars in Gaza.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1187.&mdash;Gaza passed into the hands of Saladin,
after the Battle of Hattin on July 5.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1192.&mdash;During the Third Crusade King Richard
destroyed the Castle of Dârûm at Whitsuntide.</p>

released their prisoners at Gaza.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1260.&mdash;A garrison was stationed in Gaza by the
Turkish invaders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1332.&mdash;Sir John Maundeville, a native of St.
Albans, speaks of Gaza as "a gay and rich city; and it
is very fair, and full of people, and is but a little distance
from the sea." Like other cities of old, it was, for fear
of pirates, built at some distance, about two and a half
miles, from the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1516.&mdash;The Turks crushed the Mamelukes at
Gaza. This victory opened Egypt to Selim I of Constantinople.
Egypt thus became a Pashalik of the

Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799, when its Jewish inhabitants
fled from the city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1584.&mdash;Samaritans are known to have lived in
Gaza at this date, and possessed a synagogue. Two large
baths in the city belonged to them. One of them still
bears the name of "the Bath of the Samaritans." In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
1907 an inscription was found at Gaza with a Biblical
text, in Samaritan characters. The writing is not
ancient, and it is still in the possession of the Muslim
finder. During the occupancy of the Pashas of Gaza, one
of them (of the fourth family Ridwan) desired to procure
the inn and bath belonging to the Samaritan community.
The owner objected, and gave them to the
Muslims for the benefit of the Great Mosque. The Pasha
consequently was indignant, and hanged the Samaritan at
the gate of the inn. From the end of the sixteenth
century we hear nothing more of the Samaritans at
Gaza. (For additional information see also Chapter VI.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

FRANKINCENSE (ARABIAN) AND GAZA</h2>
</div>

<p>In early times the Beduins of the desert were glad
of a market in Gaza for their spices and frankincense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
In fact, according to Dr. Meyer (from whom I freely
quote), the foundation of Gaza is most probably associated
with the Minæans in their development of the
frankincense trade. Extensive remains have been found
in Central and Southern Arabia, which have been
ascribed to these Minæans. Mr. Edward Glaser maintains
that this people existed from about the seventeenth
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and that the Sabæans followed them in the
occupancy of those regions. If this be allowed, it seems
to follow that Gaza was founded, or at least augmented,
by this early Arabian people.</p>

<p>The wealth of the Minæan kingdom was derived
chiefly from the transportation of frankincense and other
spices from the East, and from Southern Arabia, which
the caravans carried through the desert to Gaza.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In 674 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Esar-haddon, son of Sennacherib, undertook
a campaign against the Arabian tribes, put an end to
the Minæan kingdom, and secured control of the spice-trade
route.</p>

<p>During the Persian period (539-332 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) Gaza was
the chief centre of the frankincense trade.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Birdwood in his article on "The
Perfumes of the Bible," <i>Bible Educator</i>, vol. i, p. 378,
"it is very surprising that so great a weight of evidence
in favour of frankincense being produced in Arabia and
Africa should ever have been set aside for the idle fancy
that India was the source of the olibanum (ὁ λίβανος)
commerce."</p>

NOTES ON GAZA COINS</h2>
</div>

<p>An article of mine, entitled, "Notes on Gaza Coins,"
appeared in the <i>Quarterly Statement</i> of the Palestine
Exploration Fund, April 1912. Since that date my
attention has been drawn to an additional coin referred
to by Dr. Meyer in his <i>History of the City of Gaza</i>,
Chap. XVI. He begins by mentioning that an early
coin attributed to Gaza is the so-called Jehovah coin of
the British Museum. This coin is found in the printed
catalogue of 1814, although purchased about fifty years
previous. On palæographical and archæological grounds
it is assigned to about 400 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> On the obverse appears
a head with a helmet; on the reverse, a figure seated in
a chariot, with a bird in his hand. Above the figure, in
Phœnician characters, are the three letters (יהו).
A bearded head, wearing a mask, is also to be found on
the reverse.</p>

<p>The coinage of Gaza in the fifth and fourth centuries
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> has been identified by M. Six, and consists of
darics and smaller coins of Attic weight and of various
types.</p>

<p>In Nehemiah vii. 70, the Revised Version of the Old
Testament reads thus: "The Tirshatha gave to the
treasury a thousand darics of gold," whereas the
Authorised Version has "a thousand drams of gold."</p>

<p>The gold daric and siglos (silver shekel) are the first
coins that can possibly have had legal currency in
Palestine.</p>

<p>In the second half of the fifth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the wealthy
commercial cities on the Mediterranean seaboard had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
begun to issue silver money under their native kings.
The great maritime city of Gaza was among the principal
trade centres of this period.</p>

<p>Herodotus, <i>c.</i> 484-409 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (iii. 5), mentions Gaza as
scarcely inferior in size to Sardes, the capital of the
kingdom of Lydia.</p>

<p>The influence of Athens at this date is strikingly shown
by the coins of Gaza, which not only imitate the type
and legend of the coins of Athens, but are struck on the
Attic standard.</p>

<p>On March 20, 1912, at a meeting of the British
Academy, in the rooms of the Royal Society, Mr. G. F.
Hill, of the British Museum, read a paper on "Some
Cults of Palestine in the Græco-Roman Age," from which
the following passage is extracted&mdash;</p>

<p>"The coinage of Gaza entirely confirms and amplifies
the evidence which has of late been accumulating concerning
the primitive connection of the Philistine cities
with Crete. The name of the great Gazæan god Marnas,
who offered such stubborn resistance to Christianity, is
probably not Syrian but Cretan. He is the Cretan Zeus,
a young god, with a goddess resembling the huntress
Artemis for his consort, just as in Crete there seems to
be a connection between the young Zeus Velchanos and
the goddess Britomartis, who is Artemis. Gaza was a
Minoan foundation, and Minos&mdash;himself a form of the
Cretan Zeus&mdash;was worshipped at Gaza, which, indeed,
was actually called Minoa."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p>After the capture of Gaza by Alexander the Great,
332 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, regal coins were struck there with the frequent
monogram Γ͞Α, both under Ptolemy II, Philadelphus,
285-246 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, Ptolemy III, Euergetes I, 246-221 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
and Demetrius I, Soter, of Syria, 162-150 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>The autonomous bronze money of Gaza dates from an
era commencing 61 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Of this period no silver money
of Gaza is extant.</p>

<p>The imperial coins of Gaza from Augustus to Gordian
bear two different sets of dates; the first Gaza era beginning
61 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the second beginning <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 129. The
second era probably commemorates the visit of Hadrian
to Gaza.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> On some of the coins these two eras appear
concurrent. These imperial coins, with inscriptions
ΓΑΖΑΙΩΝ, ΓΑΖΑ, etc., have usually the addition of the
Phœnician letter <span class="figinline"><img src="images/mem.png" width="35" height="42" alt="" /></span>, from which the Swastica, the characteristic
mark on Gaza coins, is possibly derived, the
initial representing the divinity Marnas. The Temple of
Marnas was called the Marneion.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the last days of paganism the great god of Gaza,
now known as Marnas (our lord), was regarded as the
god of rains, and invoked against famine. That Marnas
was lineally descended from Dagon is probable, and it is
therefore interesting to note that he gave oracles, that
he had a circular temple, where he was sometimes worshipped
by human sacrifices, that there were wells in the
sacred circuit, and that there was also a place of adoration
to him, situated, in old Semitic fashion, outside the
town. Certain <i>Marmora</i> in the temple, which might not
be approached, especially by women, may perhaps be
connected with the threshold which the priests of Dagon
would not touch with their feet"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> (1 Sam. v. 5).</p>

<p>Herod Agrippa I became King of Judæa <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 41, and
possessed the entire kingdom of Herod the Great. Among
the coins of Agrippa I under Claudius, Madden (<i>Coins of
the Jews</i>, p. 137, No. 2) reproduces a coin which probably
represents a ceremony taking place in the temple of
the god Marnas at Gaza. "There were in Gaza eight
temples of the Sun, of Venus, of Apollo, of Proserpine,
and of Hecate; that which is called Heroon, or of the
Priests, that of the Fortune of the City, called Τυχεῖον, and
that of Marneion, which the citizens said is the Cretan-born
Jupiter, and which they considered to be more
glorious than any other temple in existence."</p>

<p>Dr. Donald Coles, of Haifa, has, in his collection of
over one hundred specimens of Gaza coins, an exceptionally
interesting coin of Hadrian, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 130, in excellent
condition, re-struck under Simon Bar-Cochab, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
132-135. This Hadrian bronze coin is quoted in De
Saulcy's <i>Numismatique de la Terre Sainte</i>, p. 215,
No. 1, and the re-struck coin during the Revolt of the
Jews, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 132-135 is reproduced on Plate XV, No. 4, in
his <i>Recherches sur la numismatique judaïque</i>.</p>

<p>It was not unusual for these Simon Bar-Cochab coins
to be re-struck from Ascalon, and other current coinage.</p>

<p>Among all the writers in the <i>Quarterly Statement</i> of
the P. E. F. from 1894-1901 on the Swastica, or Fylfot,
not one of them seems to be aware that the Swastica is
constantly found as the distinguishing mint-mark of
Gaza, <i>e.g.</i> on Plate XI of <i>Numismatique de la Palestine</i>,
Gaza coins, there are both the sign <span class="figinline"><img src="images/male-swastica.png" width="39" height="41" alt="" /></span> of the male Swastica,
and the more common <span class="figinline"><img src="images/female-swastica.png" width="40" height="43" alt="" /></span> female Swastica, revolving
in the opposite direction on the reverse of coins
of Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Lucius Verus, Faustina
Junior and Lucilla, Julia Domna, Plautilla, Geta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The Swastica is an Eastern symbol of the Sun, and
is occasionally known as Gammadion, and mystic Fylfot.
The latest idea formed regarding the Swastica is, that it
may be a form of the old wheel symbolism, and that it
represents the solar system. It is often connected with
the Sun, as in the Island of Melos, first colonised by
Phœnicia. Its great diffusion in Eastern Asia is due to
its being a Buddhist emblem, "the wheel of the law."</p>

<p>In the Catacombs at Rome it is well known on the
tunic of the Good Shepherd, and on the garments of the
Fossores, a class of men employed in the offices of
Christian sepulture, and in opening fresh graves and
catacombs.</p>

<p>The Triskelia, or Three Legs of the Isle of Man, and
some Syracuse coins in the reign of Agathocles, 317-289
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and other towns in Sicily, are only variants of the
Swastica.</p>

<p>Dr. Albert Churchward, in <i>The Signs and Symbols of
Primordial Man</i> (London: Swan, Sonnenschein &amp; Co.,
Ltd., 1910), supplies a mint of valuable information
scattered throughout this learned work. On page <a href="#Page_44">44</a> he
states that this Swastica was also the most sacred sign
amongst the British Druids. Page 115 (figure 49) shows
the Mexican Kalendar in form of a Swastica Cross.
On page 261 the Swastica is said to be frequently found
on stones in Devonshire, and a good specimen is in the
museum at Torquay.</p>

<p>"It is a fact that prehistoric man of the two hemispheres
had the knowledge to spin fibre and thread, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
wind it on bobbins (see spindle wheels found in museums)
having the same sign on them wherever found, viz.
the Swastika <span class="figinline"><img src="images/swastica.png" width="44" height="42" alt="" /></span>" (p. 44).</p>

<p>"This symbol has probably a wider range than any
other that has been preserved from prehistoric times"
(p. 352).</p>

<p>Dr. Churchward states, in <i>Primordial Man</i>, p. 187,
that the recent discoveries of Flinders Petrie at Abydos
tend to show that the Druids derived the Swastika from
Egypt more than 20,000 years ago!!!</p>

<p>On April 16, 1912, a few poor specimens of Roman
bronze coins struck at Gaza were brought to me in that
city, but the local finds seem to have become nearly
exhausted.</p>

<p>A representation of the temple Tychæon erected to the
Fortune of the City occurs on a coin of Antoninus and
Marcus Aurelius (shortly before <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 161), which shows
a tetrastyle temple. (Most of the temples depicted on the
Gaza coins are distyle.) The goddess of the town, as well
as the heifer, also appear on this coin.</p>

THE JEWS AT GAZA<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></h2>


<p>There is no record to show that the Jews obtained
any stronghold in Gaza during Pagan times.</p>

<p>Pompey liberated Gaza <i>c.</i> 65 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, which had been
subjected to the Jews since the times of the Maccabees,
and restored the city to its freedom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>With the institutions of Pompey, the freedom of the
Jewish people, after having existed for scarcely eighty
years, if we reckon it as beginning in 142 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, was
completely overthrown.</p>

<p>Josephus says (<i>The Jewish War</i>, II. 18, 1) that after
the people of Cæsarea had slain about 20,000 Jews,
and all the city was emptied of its Jewish inhabitants,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 66, the whole nation was greatly enraged, so the
Jews divided themselves into parties, utterly demolishing
Anthedon and Gaza.</p>

<p>Schürer (<i>History of the Jewish People in the Time of
Christ</i>, II. vol. i, p. 71), however, thinks that this must
have been a very partial destruction, for so strong a
fortress as Gaza could not have been actually destroyed
by a band of insurrectionary Jews.</p>

<p>During the middle ages, the use of wine being forbidden
to Muslims by the Kûrản, it was manufactured in Gaza
only by the Jews. This Jewish wine trade remained in
their hands exclusively for a lengthened period. There
was also a colony of wine-dealers in the harbour
Mayoumas.</p>

<p>In February 1799 most of the Jews fled when the
French troops under Napoleon entered Gaza. Meyer
says that in 1811 there were none left. Their synagogue
stood idle, and their cemetery was deserted.</p>

<p>There were supposed to be, in 1907, about one hundred
and sixty Jews in Gaza (of whom thirty were Sephardim).</p>

THE SAMARITANS</h2>
</div>

<p>Meyer supplies some valuable information about the
Samaritans in Gaza on pages 71-2, from which I gratefully
cull a few sentences. He writes of their having
settled there early, maintaining themselves as a separate
community till the modern period. A complete history is
impossible, because of the meagreness of the record. It
is remarkable how this little sect spread all over Palestine,
and even into Egypt. There are records of the Samaritans
at Gaza from the fourth to the seventeenth centuries.
According to the Samaritan Chronicle of the High Priest
Eleazar, the territory of Palestine, and other parts of
Syria and Egypt, were assigned to various Samaritan
families at the time of Baba the Great (end of fourth
century). That extending from Gaza to the River of
Egypt was given to Israel ben Machir, and Shalum was
assigned to it as Priest; the territory from Carmel to Gaza
to Laib ben Becher, with Joseph as its Priest. All the
Samaritans who settled at Gaza were of the tribe of
Benjamin, excepting Mouzaf ben Mitpalel of the tribe of
Ephraim. The Martyr Paul of Gaza, <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 300, before
his death at Cæsarea, prayed for the Samaritans of his
native town.</p>

<p>During the reign of Justinian, <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 529, the imperial
troops once occupied the city on the occasion of an
uprising of the Samaritan inhabitants of the district, and
the citizens were greatly disturbed. The Bishop Marcianus
stepped into the breach, and settled the affair by
organising a militia to which the matters in dispute were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
referred. The imperial troops were withdrawn, and peace
was restored.</p>

<p>There were many Samaritans at Gaza in the seventh
century. After the Muslim conquest, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 634, the
Samaritans of Gaza deposited their property with their
high priest, and fled to the east.</p>

<p>The five hundred Samaritans who had been captured
at Shechem by Bazawash, governor of Demascus, <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
1137, were redeemed by a co-religionist of Acre. Many
of these settled in Gaza.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1674 the Samaritans living at Gaza addressed
a letter to Robert Huntington, who was deeply interested
in their religion and literature.</p>

<p>Clermont-Ganneau reports the finding of a Samaritan
liturgical inscription at Gaza, but does not produce it
either in the original or in translation. Able also reports
a fragment of a decalogue in the Samaritan script
of the Mohammedan period.</p>

<p>Among the <i>Gleanings from the Minute Books</i> of the
Jerusalem Literature Society, November 1849, Mr. E. T.
Rogers remarks that the Samaritans are still quite a
distinct set of people, as they were in the time of our
Saviour. They make no proselytes; never intermarry
with people of other sects, and are particularly clean as a
people; none others are known than those now in Nablus.
Their principal distinction in the oriental crowd is that
they wear a crimson turban.</p>

<p>When the Rev. Dr. E. H. Thomson visited Nablus, in
May 1898, he asked after the fate of the Samaritan
community that was still surviving in Gaza when Baron
Sylvestre de Sacy, <i>c.</i> 1829, corresponded with the
Samaritans of Nablus. He was informed that the
community in Gaza had ceased to exist some sixty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
before. Now, at all events, these one hundred and sixty
Samaritans resident in Nablus are all that remain of the
Samaritan race and creed.</p>

<p>Mr. J. G. Pickard, writing from Gaza in <i>The Quarterly
Statement</i> P. E. F., July 1873, reports on the newly
discovered Samaritan Stone of which the inscription is a
passage in Deuteronomy iv. 29-31. It has been suggested
that this stone belonged to a Samaritan synagogue in
Gaza. The spot where the stone was discovered is about
a mile and a half from the sea shore.</p>

SOME EARLY BISHOPS OF (I) GAZA, (II) MAYOUMAS
(THE PORT OF GAZA)</h2>

<div class="center">Palestina Prima&mdash;Cæsarea, <i>Metropolis</i>.</div>

<p><i>The Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</i>, p. 1631, mentions
"Philemon (1) Bishop of Gaza; commemorated
February 14 (Basil Menol)."</p>

<p><i>The Kalendar of the Byzantine Church</i>, on November
22, commemorates "Philemon, Apostle."</p>

<p>The Jerusalem Archimandrite Meletius Metaxakis,
(now Bishop of Kition, Cyprus), in an article on the
Madaba Mosaic Map, <i>Nea Sion</i>, May and June 1907,
p. 485, states that "according to <i>The Ecclesiastical
Treatise about the Seventy Disciples of the Lord</i>,
Philemon, the Apostle, to whom the Epistle of Paul is
directed, became Bishop of Gaza."</p>

<p>The legendary history of Philemon supplies nothing on
which we can rely. <i>The Apostolic Constitutions</i> (vii.
46) relate that Philemon became Bishop of Colosse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
died a martyr under Nero, but this is not sustained by
any other early testimony, and is expressly denied by the
author of the <i>Commentary on St. Paul's Epistles</i>, attributed
to Hillary. This tradition, therefore, which Dr.
Meyer (p. 59) mentions, apparently without hesitation,
cannot, I think, be accepted.</p>


<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bishops of Gaza</span></h3>

<p><i>c</i>. <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 285. <span class="smcap">Sylvanus.</span> The first Christian martyr
of Gaza whose name is known. Having had his eyes
put out, he was beheaded at the Copper Mines of Phæno.</p>

<p>Commemorated May 4.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 325. Gaza was represented by a Bishop at the
Council of Nicæa. He is described as a Bishop "of <i>the
Churches round Gaza</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 341. <span class="smcap">Asclepas</span>.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> His name occurs in the Minutes
of the First Œcumenical Council. He succeeded
Sylvanus, but was deposed at a Council of Antioch, and
reinstated at a Council of Sardica.</p>

<p>He suffered many persecutions for the "Orthodox"
faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 341. <span class="smcap">Quintianus</span>, an Arian usurper of the See
of Asclepas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 363. <span class="smcap">Irenæus</span> (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 363-393) was present at the
Council of Antioch <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 363. He built the Church of
St. Irene in Gaza. The first church built in Gaza itself
was the work of St. Irenæus, who died <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 393, and
whose feast is December 16.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 393. <span class="smcap">Aeneias</span> succeeded Irenæus. His episcopate
lasted for a very short period.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 395. <span class="smcap">Porphyrius</span>, the true restorer of Christianity
in Gaza. His life was written by his trusty
deacon, Marcus. The text was published at Leipsig in
1895. Porphyrius was born in Thessalonica, <i>c</i>. <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 347,
of a good family. After a Presbyterate of three years, in
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 395 he was unwillingly consecrated Bishop of Gaza
by John of Cæsarea.</p>

<p>"Porphyry sent Marcus to Constantinople, and obtained
from the Emperor a Decree closing the Temples
of Gaza; Cynegius came to the city with Christian
police from Ascalon; the temples were closed, and the
consultation of their oracles was forbidden. Idolatry did
not cease, however; the oracles were still consulted,
though surreptitiously, for permitting which Cynegius
was said to have received a large amount of gold. The
Christians were still persecuted, and Porphyrius therefore
determined on further measures. He went to Cæsarea,
consulted with the Archbishop John, and both of them
set out for Constantinople in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 401. Through the
offices of Amantius, the Chamberlain, they were presented
to the Empress Eudoxia. They prophesied for her
the birth of a son; and the Empress vowed a church for
Gaza, if the prophecy should be fulfilled. The promised
son, Theodosius the younger, was born; and, true to her
word, Eudoxia interceded with the Emperor for a
rescript closing the Gazæan temples. For reasons of
State, the Emperor hesitated to grant the request:
'though the city is idolatrous, it is peaceful and pays its
taxes regularly. If it is disturbed, it is to be feared
that its inhabitants would desert it, and its trade be
ruined.' He therefore suggested mild means for winning
the city to Christianity. The rescript was obtained from
the Emperor at the baptism of his infant son, being
issued as the first decree of the new prince. Before the

<p>On one occasion, owing to a terrible drought at Gaza,

St. Porphyrius much influence over the heathen, and

THIRTEEN MARTYRS AT GAZA</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 304. <span class="smcap">Timotheus</span> suffered martyrdom under Urban,
the prefect of the province, in the second year of
Diocletian's persecution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 304. The Syriac version of the history of the
martyrs in Palestine states that <span class="smcap">Thecla</span> with <span class="smcap">Agapius</span>
was cast to the wild beasts in the year of Timotheus'
martyrdom.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 308. <span class="smcap">Sylvanus</span>, Bishop of Gaza, was a martyr
in the persecution of Maximianus I. He was a Presbyter
at the outbreak, and from the beginning he endured much
suffering with fortitude. Shortly before his martyrdom,
which was among the last in Palestine at that period,
he obtained the Episcopate.</p>

<p>Eusebius speaks with admiration of his Christian
endurance, saying he was "reserved until that time, that
this might be the last seal of the whole conflict in
Palestine."</p>

<p>This aged martyr was eminent for his confessions from
the very first day of the persecution. In early manhood
he had served as a soldier, before receiving Holy Orders.</p>

<p>Dr. Meyer (<i>History of the City of Gaza</i>, p. 60. New
York, 1907) states that "the first Christian martyr of Gaza
whose name is known is the Bishop Sylvanus, who met his
death in 285." Eusebius (<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, Book
VIII, Chap. XIII), however, remarks that Sylvanus was
"beheaded with thirty-nine others at the Copper Mines
of Phœne." Early Christians of Gaza were not infrequently
martyred at headquarters in Cæsarea (Palestinæ).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 308. <span class="smcap">John</span>, a student of Holy Writ and of
wonderful memory, was associated with Sylvanus. He
endured many tortures and was decapitated with his
Bishop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 308. <span class="smcap">Hatha</span> (<span class="smcap">St. Thea</span>), a virgin of Gaza,
suffered martyrdom under Firmilian in Cæsarea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 361. During the reign of Julian, the pagans of
Gaza attempted to destroy the church built by St.
Hilarion. During this revolt, Eusebius, a Gaza Christian,
with his brothers Nestabis and Zeno, were thrown into
prison, beheaded, and their bodies were burned outside
the city walls, on a spot used for the disposal of dead
animals.</p>

<p>This persecution induced all the Christians to leave
Gaza. The case was brought to the attention of the
Emperor. It seems that the heathen governor of Gaza
had imprisoned the citizens who had abused the
Christians, whereupon Julian exiled him.</p>

<p>About the same date, Nestor&mdash;a Confessor (according
to the Rev. S. Baring-Gould, <i>Lives of the Saints</i>)&mdash;was
killed of wounds inflicted by the populace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1370. The Franciscan Chronicles of the fourteenth
century relate that a Franciscan friar, John of
Naples, went from Jerusalem to Gaza, and was subjected
to a cruel martyrdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1555. Two French pilgrims were arrested at
Gaza, and on their refusing to renounce the religion of
Christ were put to death. Their bodies, carried away
by the Christians, were buried under Orthodox Greek

ST. HILARION, THE FIRST HERMIT OF PALESTINE
(<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 290-371).</h2>
</div>

<p>"The solitary life never found so many votaries in
Europe as in Egypt and Palestine. Partly because of
the comparative inclemency of the climate, and the proportionate
need of more appliances to support life, and
partly because of the more practical character of the
West. As might be expected, for obvious reasons there
have been fewer female hermits" (<i>Dictionary of Christian
Antiquities</i>: Article <span class="smcap">Hermits</span>, 1875).</p>

<p>During the third century, Eremites (from ἐρῆμος, desert),
or <i>Hermits</i>, retired entirely from the haunts of men, and
buried themselves in the wildest and most inaccessible
solitudes.</p>

<p>In Palestine, the hermit life was introduced by St.
Hilarion, a disciple of St. Antony.</p>

<p>The first Palestinian convent was founded by St.
Hilarion, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 328. He was pre-eminently a teacher.
Every novice was given a special occupation.</p>

<p>Hilarion was born at Thabatha, a village five miles to
the south of Gaza, <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 290, of heathen parents, who
sent him to Alexandria for education. There he showed
proficiency in rhetoric. He became a Christian, and
turning from the attractions of the circus and theatre,
spent all his leisure in attending Church services.</p>

<p>The monastic retreat of St. Antony, the founder of
Asceticism, attracted Hilarion, and he became his
enthusiastic disciple for two months.</p>

<p>Next neighbours to the Church of Egypt, the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Christians of Gaza naturally imitated the asceticism of
Antony, and avowed the orthodoxy of Athanasius.
Hilarion found, however, that his mountain retreat was
too much thronged with followers to suit his taste. At
the age of fifteen years he therefore decided to become
a hermit. He returned to Palestine, and finding his
parents dead, he gave away all his goods, and went to
live in a desert spot seven miles from the Christian city
of Mayoumas.</p>

<p>The boy hermit was clad in a sackcloth shirt, which he
never changed till it was worn out, a cloak of skins which
Antony had given him, and a blanket, such as peasants
wore.</p>

<p>His earliest diet was a daily fast until sunset, and then
a supper of fifteen figs. His employment was basket-making,
after the fashion of the Egyptian monks. His
dwelling was so small as rather to resemble a tomb.
He had resided in the desert twenty-two years when he
first became celebrated for his miracles.</p>

<p>The first miracle of healing with which St. Hilarion
is credited was the restoration to health of three children
at Gaza, whose mother had induced him to come forth
from his retreat to see them. Standing beside their bed,
the hermit merely uttered the word "<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>," and they
at once recovered. On his return to his cell he was so
besieged by other applicants for relief that he could no
longer lead his secluded life.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In his sixty-third year, hearing of the decease of St.
Antony, St. Hilarion resolved to visit the place where the
great recluse had entered into rest, hoping thus to escape
from the crowds by whom he was now constantly surrounded.
Resisting all the efforts of the Egyptian hermits
to become their leader, he returned alone to Gaza, but no
sooner had he left them than messengers arrived with
orders from Julian the Apostate to slay Hilarion, and his
disciple Hesychius, wherever they should be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>During Hilarion's absence in Egypt, the heathen
citizens of Gaza destroyed his monastery at Mayoumas.</p>

<p>During his life of fifty years in Palestine, he visited
the holy sites but once, and for a single day&mdash;in order, as
he said, that he might neither appear to despise them on
account of their meanness, nor to suppose that God's
grace was limited to any particular place. During,
apparently, this short visit to Jerusalem, a pleasing
story is told of him in connection with his friend St.
Epiphanius, Archbishop of Constantia (formerly Salamîs)
and Metropolitan of Cyprus. Hilarion called upon this
Bishop. Some fowls were served up at the table, and
St. Epiphanius asked his guest to partake of them.
Hilarion excused himself, saying that, since he put on the
habit of a recluse, he had never eaten of any animal.
"And I," said Epiphanius, "since I put on the same
habit, have never allowed that any one should lie down
to sleep with a grievance against me on his mind, even as
I have never gone to rest at variance with any one."
"Father," replied the hermit, "your rule is more excellent
than mine."</p>

<p>For additional information concerning the celebrated St.
Epiphanius, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 368-404, and his intimate connection
with St. Hilarion, see Hackett's <i>History of the Orthodox
Church of Cyprus</i>, pp. 399-407, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p>"Our Father and Archbishop Epiphanius of Cyprus"
is commemorated in the Byzantine Kalendar on May 12.</p>

<p>At last, in a wilderness near Paphos in Cyprus, death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
released Hilarion, this much persecuted saint, from importunities.
Almost with his last breath he expressed
a wish as to where his body was to be buried&mdash;without
pomp or ceremony. His wishes were respected, but his
friend and favourite disciple, Hesychius, stole his body
from the grave, re-interring it in his own monastery
at Mayoumas. A rivalry ensued between the places of
the first and second interments; miracles were said to
be performed at both.</p>

<p>According to Sozomen, his festival was observed in
Palestine with great solemnity as early as the fifth
century.</p>

<p>St. Hilarion's name occurs in the Byzantine Kalendar
on October 21, as</p>

SOZOMEN, CHURCH HISTORIAN (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 400&mdash;<i>c.</i> 450)</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Salamanes Hermias Sozomenus</span>, called Scholasticus,
came of a wealthy family, and was born at Bethelia, a
small town close to Gaza, <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 400, where his grandfather
had been one of the first to embrace Christianity,
probably under Constantius, through the influence of St.
Hilarion. This hermit, among his other miracles, had
miraculously healed an acquaintance of Sozomen's
grandfather, one Alaphion. Both men, with their
families, became zealous Christians, and were conspicuous
for their virtues. Having been endowed with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
natural ability, this ancestor of Sozomen was distinguished
as an interpreter of Holy Scripture, and held
fast his Christian profession, even in the time of Julian.
Sozomen was educated at first in Bethelia, among the
monks, for some memories of his youth are connected
with the neighbourhood of Gaza. In early manhood he
went to Berytus (Beirût)<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> to be trained in civil law at its
famous school. As a man he retained the impressions of
his youth. When he became an Advocate of Constantinople,
he wrote his chief work, Ἐκκλησιαστικὴ Ἱστορία.
<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 440.&mdash;It consisted of nine books, from <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 323-423,
a continuation of Eusebius. It is a monument of his
reverence for the monks in general, and also for the
disciples of St. Hilarion in particular. He dedicated it
to the Emperor Theodosius II. What Sozomen has to
tell of the history of Southern Palestine was derived
from oral tradition. Sozomen died <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 450.</p>

<p>Bethelia was formerly a town with a famous heathen
temple, renowned for its beauty and age, which Sozomen
calls "the village of the Gazæans." It is now the Arabic
Beit Lehia, which lies among the olive groves north of the
city, and retains its religious character by the mosque
and minaret which, no doubt, replaced the ancient
temple.</p>

THE ORTHODOX GREEK CHURCH IN GAZA</h2>
</div>

<p>On April 17, 1912, an opportunity was afforded me of
a lengthy conversation with the Archimandrite Antonius,
who was educated at the convent of the Cross, Jerusalem,
and the Greek College, Halki, Sea of Marmora. He has
been in charge of the Orthodox Syrian congregation at
Gaza during the last seven years.</p>

<p>I inquired as to the exact spot where St. Hilarion,
the first hermit of Palestine, was buried. It seems that
both Christians and Muslims reverence his grave at
Deir-el-Belah (the ancient Ed-Dârûm), two hours' ride
south of Gaza, where the mosque Jami el-Khidr stands
on the site of an old chapel.</p>

<p>In the fourth century there were several hermits at
Thabatha, one and a half hours' ride to the south of Gaza.
During the fifth century the existence of three ancient
city churches is recorded: Eudoxiana, Irene, and the
Church of the Holy Apostles on the south. The two
new churches were St. Sergius and St. Stephen the
Protomartyr.</p>

<p>The Archimandrite stated that the dedication of his
church was associated with the name of St. Porphyrius,
and was built in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 443. The grave of this early Gaza
prelate is within the church, which was restored in
1866. There is an ancient circular marble font for
immersion in the north-west of the nave.</p>

<p>The Patriarch Damianus on one occasion visited Gaza,
but Sophronius, its titular Bishop, has never entered
the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>A native Arabic-speaking priest is associated with the
Archimandrite. The services are rendered in Greek,
although the Epistles and Gospels are said in Arabic.
The whole of the congregation of one thousand "Orthodox"
are only familiar with Arabic. The two Orthodox
schools contain ninety boys and twenty-five girls. A
friendly feeling exists between these Orthodox Christians
and Muslims.</p>

"EUDOXIANA"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></h2>


<p>1. The Emperor Arcadius married Eudoxia, a beautiful
Frank maiden, the daughter of Bauto, who had held
office as master of the soldiery.</p>

<p>Arcadius, always weak and indolent, was accustomed
to be ruled by his clever wife. "She imagined herself
to be religious, because she was liberal in almsgiving,
and in building churches, attended the Church services,
reverenced the relics of martyrs, and patronised the
clergy, so long as they let her have her own way. But
she was superstitious, thoroughly worldly-minded, avaricious,
absorbed in luxuries and pleasures, and these of a not
very innocent character. She at first welcomed St. Chrysostom,
and assured him of her favour, but soon turned
against him."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Her death occurred on October 4, 404.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>2. At the end of the fourth century there were eight
heathen temples within the city&mdash;that of the Sun, of
Venus, of Apollo, of Koré (Proserpina), of Hecate, that
known as the Heroon (Ἡρῷον), of Juno, of the City's
fortune called the Tychæon (Τυχεῖον<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>) depicted on the
coins of Gaza, and lastly that of Marnas, that is to say
the Marneion, which was thought as being that of Zeus
of Crete, and was held to be the most famous of all
the temples. There were, besides, numberless idols in
the houses and in the villages. A church was built on the
site of the Marneion, which latter was destroyed by order
of the Empress Eudoxia. The plans of the new church
were sent from Constantinople, and were adapted by the
architect Rufinus, of Antioch. The construction of the
church took five years to complete. It was consecrated
by Porphyrius on Easter Day, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 406, and dedicated to
St. John Baptist. The Deacon Mark (Biographer of
Bishop Porphyrius) says that there were about one
thousand hermits present at its consecration.</p>

<p>"The enforcement of Arcadius' Decree was entrusted
to Cynegius, who arrived at Gaza ten days after Porphyrius
with a force of soldiers and a body of civil
officers. When the order for closing the temples was
read, the citizens protested; but the soldiers carried out
the Imperial commands, and were aided by the Christians
and the sailors. The fiercest opposition was encountered
at the Marneion, where the priests blocked the entrance
with large stones. Seeing, however, that their defence
was vain, they buried the temple treasures and escaped.
The Marneion was then burned; it took ten days to
complete the destruction of all the temples. After the
site of the Marneion had been purified, a cruciform
church was built on it out of the funds furnished by
Eudoxia, after whom it was named the 'Eudoxiana.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>"The courtyard of the church was paved with stones
taken from the Marneion, and the women of Gaza
refused to walk in it because of their strong attachment to
the old cult."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The Eudoxiana was eventually converted into a mosque,
and the Roman garrison, consisting of sixty soldiers
under the command of Callinicus, having refused to
apostatise, were slain at Eleutheropolis and Jerusalem.</p>

THE CRUSADERS AT GAZA (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1100-1291)</h2>


<p>Of seven towns along the Palestine and Syrian coast
Ascalon was brought into the most frequent contact with
the Crusaders, and Gaza received the fewest visits. "The
Crusaders alone do not appear to have used Gaza for
commerce, because this city was never so securely in
their hands as to permit them to dominate the roads
south and east for any distance."&mdash;<i>G. A. Smith.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1100.&mdash;The Crusaders rebuilt the castle in the
centre of the city, and from this date Ascalon was made
of more importance by the Christians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1149.&mdash;The most renowned of the three great
military orders founded in the twelfth century for the
defence of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem was that of
the Knights Templars. From the first this order was
strictly a military one. White mantles were worn with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a red cross. After Baldwin III returned from Antioch,
towards the end of 1149, he was engaged in building a
fortress at Gaza.</p>

<p>It was nearly completed in the spring of 1150, and was
handed over to the Knights Templars.</p>

<p>Gaza was the last Christian stronghold in the Maritime
Plain on the south towards Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1154.&mdash;The famous geographer Idrîsi, who wrote
of the Holy City as it was during the occupation of the
Crusaders, states that Ghazzah is to-day very populous,
and is in the hands of the Greeks (Crusaders). The port
of Ghazzah is called Tîda or Taidâ.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1160.&mdash;Dirghâm, the Egyptian, conquered the
Franks in a battle at, or near, Gaza.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1170.&mdash;After the death of the great Imad-ed-din
Zanki, ruler of Mosul, he was succeeded by his two sons.
One of them, Saif-ed-din Gazi, secured Mosul, and the
eastern part of his father's dominions. The other, Nur-ed-din
Mohammed, became the chief Moslem prince in
Syria, with Aleppo for his capital. In the beginning of
December 1170, Nur-ed-din being in the north, Salah-ed-din
made a dash against Gaza, and destroyed its
suburbs. He plundered the town, but was unable to
reduce the fortress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1177.&mdash;Salah-ed-din, towards the end of 1177,
arrived before Ascalon. The Knights Templars were for
the most part in Gaza. The Crusaders came upon
Saladin's main body while it was crossing a stream, and
was obstructed in its movements by the baggage. The
Muslims were easily routed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1187.&mdash;After the Battle of Hattin, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1187, and
the surrender of Ascalon to Saladin, Gaza also passed
into his hands. It appears also to have opened its gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to Richard I of England for a short time, but it soon
reverted to the Muslims.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1192.&mdash;King Richard, during the third Crusade,
took the fortress Dârôn (Latin Darum), built by King
Amalrich, a coast city, immediately south of Gaza, after
a short siege, and destroyed it.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>King Richard reconquered Gaza, placing it in the
charge of the Knights Templars, who previously had
charge of it.</p>

<p>The walls were dismantled after Richard Cœur de
Lion's peace with Saladin, in 1193.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1239.&mdash;A new Crusade arrived in September
1239. Theobald, Count of Champagne and King of
Navarre, was its most important leader. Several
hundred knights surprised the Muslims in the neighbourhood
of Gaza. The result was a serious disaster.
The Latins were attacked and practically cut to pieces on
November 13. This rebuff occurred in spite of the
remonstrances of Theobald. No precautions having been
taken by the Duke of Burgundy, the Counts of Bar and
Mountfort, they suddenly found themselves nearly
surrounded by the enemy in a narrow pass. There was
yet time for them to escape by retreating rapidly by the
way in which they had entered; but the majority refused
to do this, as inconsistent with the high courage which
they professed, and after a desperate struggle Count de
Bar was slain, and Amory de Mountfort, with many nobles
and knights, were taken captives. The main body of the
Crusaders arrived too late to be of any assistance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1242.&mdash;Damascus had been in Nejm-ed-din Ayub's
hands during the early part of 1239, and had been taken
from him by Imad-ed-din Ismail. In May 1242, the
Knights Templars and their Muslim allies defeated an
Egyptian army on the borders of Palestine. The Egyptians
lost heavily, and were driven back to Gaza, which
was their base of operations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1244.&mdash;Ayub in his trouble found allies in an
unexpected quarter. The Kharezmian Turks had recently
been driven from their homes by the Tartar invasion, and
were ready to put their swords at the disposal of the
highest bidder. These savages, at the invitation of Ayub,
entering from the north, flowed like a tide past Safed and
Jerusalem, and on St. Luke's Day (October 18, 1244),
annihilated the Christian and Saracen armies united for
a common cause in the valley of Gaza. History records
few more terrible struggles than this decisive battle,
which lasted without ceasing from the rising to the
setting of the sun, and was renewed on the morrow with
the same ferocity. Thirty thousand of the military Orders
are said to have been slain; thirty-three Templars,
twenty-six Hospitallers, and three Teutonic Knights alone
escaped of these brave Orders. The Master of the
Temple was amongst the slain, and the Master of the
Hospital was amongst those taken captive.</p>

<p>From this blow the Latin Kingdom of the East never
recovered. And since this date Gaza has remained a
town of comparatively little importance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1250.&mdash;King Louis IX (St. Louis of France) and
the Mameluke Emirs agreed that all prisoners taken
since the Battle of Gaza, in 1244, should be released.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1250.&mdash;Malek-el-Nâsir of Damascus, as descendant
of Saladin, besieged Gaza. Ebek, the first of the
Mameluke Slave Dynasty, sent his General Aktai to
relieve the city, in which he succeeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1260.&mdash;The whole of Palestine was raided by the
Tartar invaders, and they stationed garrisons in towns
as remote as Gaza.</p>

<p>The Mongols under Hûlagû, sent an Embassy from
Gaza, to El-Mudhaffer Kutuy, Sultan of Egypt, demanding
his submission.</p>

<p>The Sultan Edh-Dhahir Beibars drove the Mongols out
of Gaza.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1280.&mdash;Kilâwûn, Sultan of Egypt, marched
against the Mongols, and encamped at Gaza for fifty
days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1291.&mdash;The Egyptian Sultan, Melik-el-Ashraf,
made Gaza a separate government, and set up a Governor
there.</p>

<p>This put an end to the Frank rule in Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

THE PASHAS OF GAZA</h2>


<p>Al Nadwan, and other Pashas, ruled Gaza and all
Palestine for more than two hundred years. Under the
Sultans of Turkey, these Pashas, seven in number,
occupied the city after the crusading period. They began
to rule from about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1510.</p>

<p>They possessed much property in many parts of the
country. The present British Consular Agent's house
belonged to one of these Pashas.</p>

<p>The old court (serai) belonged to them, and the present
barracks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>All the existing fine buildings were erected by them.</p>

<p>The minaret at the Great Mosque, and two other
minarets at the Sajaiah, were also constructed in their
day.</p>

<p>They governed all Palestine and Syria, having their
headquarters in Gaza. Consequently, in the middle of
the seventeenth century Gaza once assumed somewhat
of its former importance.</p>

<p>Their rule was arbitrary. Pilgrims proceeding to
Jerusalem from Jaffa were compelled to get permission
from the Pasha at Gaza.</p>

<p>If anyone built a house, or owned anything particularly
interesting, the Pashas would lay claim to it by using the
expression "Mabrook" (Blessed). If the owner did not
reply favourably he was immediately hanged.</p>

<p>Hussein Pasha (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1660) made Gaza the capital of
Palestine. His serai, which was furnished with great
luxury, stood in the middle of a beautiful Gaza garden.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
One family was called the Frangi. They were the
Pashas' gardeners. Their descendants became Muslims.</p>

<p>When the Turks came to Gaza the Pashas only lost
the serai and barracks, their other property was not
interfered with. It now belongs to their descendants,
who are all poor people, and live on their rents.</p>

<p>These Pashas had their own burying ground, which is
still seen, and known as the Pashas' cemetery.</p>

<p>When Napoleon Bonaparte came to Gaza (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
February 1799) the city was not ruled by any power,
and the taxes were collected for him by a private
individual.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>After the rule of the Pashas, the Muftis governed
Gaza&mdash;the Turkish Government coming into office in
1852.</p>

<p>It has been extremely difficult to obtain this scanty
information about the Gaza Pashas.</p>

DAGON, THE NATIONAL GOD OF THE PHILISTINES</h2>


<p>Dagon was represented with the face and hands of
a man and the tail of a fish (1 Samuel v. 4). Various
kinds of fish were objects of general worship among the
Egyptians.</p>

<p>The worship of Dagon did not exclude that of other
Baals (2 Kings i. 2, 3). He was eminently the god of
agriculture (1 Samuel vi. 4, 5).</p>

<p>The most famous temples of Dagon were at Gaza
(Judges xvi. 21, 30) and Ashdod (1 Samuel v. 5, 6).
This latter temple was of pre-Maccabean construction,
and was destroyed by Jonathan, the brother of Judas
the Maccabee (c. 148 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) during the Maccabean wars
(1 Maccabees x. 84).<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>In connection with the history of Samson at Gaza,
Mr. R. A. Stewart-Macalister, 1905, explains the
architectural character of the Gaza Temple of Dagon.
It must have consisted essentially of three members: the
cella itself; a very deep distyle portico, and a forecourt,
open to the sky. What seems to have happened was
this: the blind prisoner was conducted to the forecourt,
whence he could be seen by the Philistine grandees, who
sat in the shade of the portico (cf. verse 30, "the house
fell <i>upon</i> the Lords"), as well as by the large crowd of
commoners assembled on the roof. By tricks of strength
and buffoonery he was compelled to give them amusement,
after which he was allowed to rest awhile, probably
in order that he might have strength to continue the
sport. He was set to rest between the pillars, which
was the nearest place where he could be shaded from the
sun's heat while resting. Taking the opportunity, he put
forth his full strength, and before the lords of the
Philistines realised what he was doing, he was able
slightly to displace the posts holding up the portico, but
sufficiently to cause them to fall under the weight of the
roof.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Colonel Conder remarks it is often denied that the
name Dagon applies to the Babylonian and Phœnician
deity represented as a merman, with the head and body
of a bearded man, and the tail of a fish; because in
Semitic speech <i>Dagon</i> signifies "Corn." It is, however,
recognised that Dagon is the same god, called <i>Da-gan</i> in
the Akkadian Chronicle of the first dynasty of Babylon;
and in Akkadian <i>Da</i> signifies "the upper part of a man,"
while <i>gan</i> may be compared with Turkish <i>kan</i> for a large
fish. Dagon would thus be the same as Oannes (u-khana,
"lord of the fish"), a form of the sea-god Ea, who was
a man with fish tail. He is represented not only on
Assyrian bas-reliefs, but on a seal found near Ashdod
in 1875. When the statue of Dagon was broken only the
"fishy part" (dagon) was left. In the Laws of Ammurabi,
Dagon is invoked as the deity of regions near the
Euphrates, apparently as a water-god.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Prof. Sayce and others now insist that Dagon was
not a <i>fish</i>-god. The name and worship of Dagon were
imported into Philistia from Babylonia.</p>

THE GAZA JUPITER</h2>


<p>The great statue from Gaza was discovered on
September 6, 1879, by the natives at Tell 'Ajjûl, about
four miles and a half south of Gaza. Captain Conder, in
1882, reported that we owe its preservation to the
exertions of the Rev. A. W. Schapira, the C.M.S.
missionary at Gaza. The Arabs had at once commenced
to break up the statue, and had succeeded in greatly
damaging the face. Mr. Schapira persuaded the Turkish
Governor to set a guard over the spot. The antiquarians
of Palestine owe him a debt of gratitude for having
prevented the entire destruction of this unique monument.</p>

<p>Dr. Meyer, in his <i>History of the City of Gaza</i>, Note,
on page 153, states that this statue was rescued by the
missionary Schapira, and adds in a note on page 156,
"that Schapira's connection with the finding of the
statue tended at first to discredit the authenticity of the
find, because of his previous share in the famous
Moabite forgeries. But nothing has ever been advanced
to show that this statue shares the character of his other
discoveries."</p>

<p>Dr. Meyer is mistaken in attributing the Moabite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
forgeries to the Rev. Alexander Wilhelm Schapira, who
was formerly a Church Missionary Society clergyman at
Gaza. It was Mr. M. W. Schapira whose name became
connected with the celebrated Schapira collection of
forgeries in 1873.</p>

<p>The following appeared in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>,
November 11, 1879&mdash;</p>

<p>"An interesting archæological discovery is reported
from Palestine. An Arab who was quarrying stone the
other day at a place about four miles and a half from
Gaza unearthed a marble figure supposed to be a colossal
god of the Philistines. The dimensions of the figure
are as follows: Three feet from the top of its head to
the end of its beard, twenty-seven inches from ear to
ear, thirteen and a half inches from top of forehead
to mouth, fifty-four inches from shoulder to shoulder,
eighty-one inches from crown of head to waist, and
fifty-four inches the circumference of the neck. The
total height of the figure is fifteen feet. The hair hangs
in long ringlets down upon the shoulders, and the beard
is long, indicating a man of venerable age. The right
arm is broken in half, while the left arm is crossed over
the breast to the right shoulder, where the hand is hidden
by the drapery of a cloth covering the shoulders. There
is no inscription on the figure, or the pedestal, which is
a huge block carved in one piece with the figure. The
statue was found in a recumbent position, buried in the
sand, on the top of a hill near the sea. It had evidently
been removed from its original site, which is unknown.
Its estimated weight is 12,000 lbs. The Pasha of
Jerusalem has ordered a guard to watch this relic of
ancient art, and to prevent any injury to it by the
fanatics of Gaza."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Conder, in his notes from Constantinople,
July 1882, sent a copy of the sketch which he had made
from the original of the Gaza Jupiter in the porch of the
Stamboul Museum, which is reproduced in the <i>Quarterly
Statement</i> P. E. F., July 1882, p. 148.</p>

<p>Conder supposed that the terrible mutilations of this
Jupiter may have been effected before the statue was
discovered, and it is possible that the pious pagans may
have buried their Jupiter to save him from the Christians,
and have been obliged to divide it for facility of
transport.</p>

AN OLD SARCOPHAGUS AT GAZA<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></h2>


<p>The Jerusalem paper, <i>El-Kuds</i>, in its issue of February
25, 1910, gave an interesting account of a discovery made
at Gaza, and Prof. R. A. S. Macalister has kindly
forwarded a translation of the relevant portions of the
description. After some remarks on the history of Gaza,
the paper proceeds as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have been induced to record the above by our
having heard that Musa el-Burtu and his partner, Ibn
Halaweh, of the people of Gaza, bought land at Gaza for
six hundred dollars; and that when Musa went to his
land, and was working and digging in it, he found a little
door. He entered by it into a cave divided into two
chambers, and, entering through the second door, he
found a coffin of hard wood. And he opened it, and in
the coffin was another of crystal. And he broke this, and
inside it he found one of the old queens embalmed, and
on her head a crown adorned with precious stones, and on
her neck a necklace of pearls, and three chains besides on
her breast; and above her head was a candlestick of gold
with a spout, a metre and a half long, and another at her
foot a metre long. And he collected all these things and
brought them to Beirût, and thence to Egypt; and we
have learnt that he sent to his partner in Gaza to pay to
the workmen a sum of five hundred napoleons.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>"And when the Government heard of this they sent,
on their part, a number of people to the said place to
preserve and protect it, because the tomb in which the
queen was found is of marble, and her portrait is carved
on it. And there are other graves besides."</p>

<p>We are, fortunately, able to supplement this by an
account sent to us by Mr. Emil G. Knesevich, of Gaza,
who has also kindly forwarded a photograph of the
sarcophagus.</p>

<p>"At the commencement of 1910, some men were
digging out stones in their orange garden, about two miles
to the north-west of Gaza, and after reaching a depth of
six metres, came upon the ruins of an old door, which
led to a big cave about five metres by six metres, and
about three metres in height. In the floor and walls of
this cave, some tombs were found containing bones, the
remains of dead bodies, and a number of idols resembling
men, monkeys, eagles, and dogs. These were made of
clay and plaster of Paris, and were tinged with a beautiful
green tint. In the cave another door was observed;
this led to another small cave about two metres by three
metres, and two metres in height, in which was found the
sarcophagus, of which the following is a description&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"The sarcophagus was by itself in the inner cave,
strongly fortified by a sort of a vault built over it of huge
stones and plaster of Paris, to prevent it from being
damaged. When the stones were removed there appeared
this beautiful and remarkable sarcophagus. It was made
of pure white marble, and was composed of two pieces,
the lid and the coffin. When the lid was taken away,
there was found the mummy of a female in a fine state of
preservation. The coffin was two hundred and twenty
centimetres long, seventy centimetres wide, and seventy-two
centimetres high. Unfortunately, the men who
found the mummy destroyed it in searching the coffin,
hoping to find precious antiques, but they assert that they
found nothing, save an artificial tooth attached to a golden
wire. Some people say, however, that a book and some
precious things were discovered. No inscription of any
kind was upon the sarcophagus.</p>

<p>"The lid was beautifully and artistically carved in the
exact form of the mummy. Nothing except the head,
neck, and shoes were seen, and the rest of the body was
carved so as to appear swathed in bandages of linen.
The head was neatly fashioned, and the eyes and lips
were painted their natural colour. The head was bound
with a fillet, the hair was loose and thrown on both sides
of the chest. The head, fillet, and the nose suggest that
the mummy was a Roman, but the shoes, as carved on
the lid, are Egyptian.</p>

<p>"The lower part of the coffin also was cut in the shape
of the body, as shown in the photograph. The place
that supported the head was carved to resemble the head
and neck, and the lower part of the coffin, that rested on
the ground, is carved in the shape of the back part of
the body. The local government got possession of the
sarcophagus, and dispatched it to Constantinople, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>

idols, on the 26th of May last."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

human figure with four wings, seemingly like those of a fly or bee,
and with a large misshapen human head. In each hand the figure
holds an animal resembling an ape, head downwards, being held by
the hind leg. Dr. De Haas supposed this to be an effigy of Baalzebub,
god of Ekron, to whom apes were sometimes offered. The
seal is square, about one inch wide, and the figure in low relief,
roughly cut. A similar seal was found some years ago, and is now
in England. It represents a fly or mosquito, with an inscription,

THE GREAT MOSQUE</h2>


<p>The one object of archæological interest in Gaza is the
Great Mosque (Djamia el Kebîr) which rises on the top
of the hill in the middle of the upper city. This mosque
is built upon the site of the Basilica, which the Empress
Eudoxia founded, where the Marneion formerly stood,
and was built of ancient materials.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century it was a splendid cathedral
dedicated to St. John Baptist.</p>

<p>The style of architecture is severe, and the ornamentation
very plain. The fine groined roof is entire.</p>

<p>The mosque has three aisles, two of which formed part
of the mediæval church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Rows of pillars, with Corinthian capitals, divide them
one from the other.</p>

<p>The roof of the central nave is supported by rows of
pillars, one above the other, each pillar of the lower row
having a cluster of small marble pillars round it, for
greater strength.</p>

<p>One of the upper pillars on the north-east side of the
mosque, of grey veined marble, bears a bas-relief of a
seven-branched candlestick, with a Greek and Hebrew
inscription of three lines inside a wreath. It belongs,
as M. Clermont-Ganneau surmises, to one of the thirty
columns sent by the Empress Eudoxia, and probably
comes from the Synagogue of Cæsarea.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The walls and ceiling are now whitewashed. The
church was undoubtedly decorated with mosaic and
pictures.</p>

<p>The three apses have disappeared to make room for a
large octagonal minaret.</p>

<p>On the south side the Moslems have built an additional
aisle.</p>

<p>The total length of the building is one hundred and
eight and a half feet, interior measure, the nave being
twenty-one and a half feet wide, and the aisles thirteen
feet.</p>

<p>The west doorway is a beautiful mediæval specimen of
the Italian Gothic of the twelfth century churches in
Palestine, with delicate clustered shafts and pillars,
deeply undercut lily-leaves adorning the capitals.</p>

<p>Lieut. Kitchener, in 1874, took a photograph of the
western door as well as the interior of the mosque.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>The large marble cruciform font has been removed and
it now lies in the courtyard adjoining the mosque, where
two other Christian symbols may be seen, viz. a bishop's
staff, and chalice in marble.</p>

<p>Another view of the history of this mosque is given
by the Archimandrite Meletius Metaxakis, in an article
on the Madaba Mosaic Map, in <i>Nea Sion</i>, March and
April 1907, pp. 262-304, in which he states that the
modern authors of <i>Guides to Palestine</i> hold that the
Eudoxian Church is the modern Great Mosque, Djamia-el-Kebîr,
taking into consideration, it seems, the information
that the Eudoxian Church was to be built in the
middle of the city. If, however, we are to accept that
the sketch on the chart shows the Eudoxian Church,
then we ought to treat the Eudoxian Church as identical,
not with the mosque, but rather with the Modern Orthodox
Church, built in 1856, during the Patriarchate of
Kyrillus II (1845-1872), and through the expenditure of
the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre. With regard to
its position, the Greek Church is wholly identical with
the sketch on the chart.</p>

<p>With regard to the mosque, this is really a three-branched
church, being perhaps one of the churches built
by Marcian; the columns of this church (having no
connection with those from Constantinople for the
Eudoxian Church) appear to have been transported from
some Hebrew synagogue, perhaps that of Cæsarea,
because there is engraved on one of them a seven-branched
lamp, under which appears the Hebrew and
Greek inscription, "Hananias the son of Jacob."</p>

GAZA&mdash;THE KEY OF SYRIA</h2>
</div>

<p>Gaza&mdash;the outpost of Africa, and the door of Asia&mdash;is
situated in the south-west of Palestine, and is only
about twelve miles to the north of Reifah (formerly
Raphia), which marks the Turko-Egyptian boundary,
running down to Akaba. Who founded the city is unknown!
It is the commercial and administrative centre
of all the surrounding sixty-two villages, and for many
of the Beduin tribes who pitch their tents in the plains.
The area of Gaza is about 2,100 square kilometres. The
present city is about two miles from the sea,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and lies on
an artificial mound which is about 100 feet high above
the plain, and 180 feet above the sea-shore. Five
minarets break the outline of the flat roofs. There are
no scavengers.</p>

<p>The encroachment of the rolling dunes of sand is one
of the most serious evils now to be dreaded on the coast of
Palestine. Nothing is done to arrest this enemy around
Gaza.</p>

<p>The trade and commerce of Gaza are almost exclusively
confined to the gathering in and exportation of
barley, which is grown on the plain of Philistia, and in
the neighbourhood of Beersheba. The majority of the
inhabitants of the city and district obtain their livelihood
from this trade alone. The widespread olive-grove to
the north and north-east, however, creates a considerable
manufacture of soap, which Gaza exports in large
quantities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>The soil is very fertile, but its productiveness is entirely
dependent on the rainfall, and in consequence the
yield of the crops greatly affects the general condition
of the people. The most primitive methods of cultivation
are still in general use.</p>

<p>The climate is sub-tropical, and upon the whole
healthy. Eye diseases, however, are very prevalent.
Malaria and other tropical diseases are also common.</p>

<p>The chief exports besides barley are wheat, millet,
and colocynth, while a coasting trade is carried on in
"tibn" (chopped straw) and a coarse black pottery,
which is the principal manufacture of Gaza, where there
is a good market for it. The poor people of the district
buy it, and exchange it for cereals and other articles.</p>

<p>From at least 727 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Gaza has been famous for its
potteries, of which there are now forty-two within the
city. The same method of producing this pottery is
used to-day as depicted upon the Egyptian monuments.
This manufacture was called "Gazaitæ."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The only other manufactures are a common kind of soap,
and cloth, consisting principally of the coarse woollen
coats ('abaï) worn by the men. There are also mills
for the expression of sesame oil, and for grinding corn.</p>

<p>Cotton goods, and most of the articles necessary for
wear, or luxury, are imported. The chief imports from
Great Britain are unbleached calicos, which are used by
the fellahin for clothing. They are dyed blue locally.
Aniline dyes are imported from Germany. The average
yearly value of the yarn imported into Gaza and Mejdel
from Manchester is £10,000. The imports are mostly
brought from Beirût or Jaffa by small coasting craft, or
overland by camels.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>The average orange crop of late years has been good.
The fruit is excellent. It is better than that of Jaffa, both
in taste and in size. Eight thousand boxes were exported,
chiefly to Great Britain, in 1910 (valued at
£8,000). These orange gardens are gradually increasing,
their present number being about twenty. The soil is
rich, and excellent for the purpose.</p>

<p>Gaza has no harbour, or any convenient facility for
shipping cargo. A pier was constructed in 1906, but it
proved a complete failure, on account of its being
inadequate to meet the need. It should have been built
120 yards longer. In 1909 the violence of the waves
during that winter destroyed about one-third of it.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of surf in the summer, and
steamers are often delayed fourteen to twenty days
before obtaining their cargo. No regular steamers touch
this roadstead, and it is only in summer that these
vessels (mostly British) visit it. There is no lighthouse.</p>

<p>It is at this point that the ancient maritime suburb of
Mayoumas stood, the concrete remains of which are still
visible on the shore.</p>

<p>The population is about 70,000, including the surrounding
villages. The fellahin form the bulk of the
population&mdash;mostly of the poorer classes. The non-increase
of population is due to the bad harvests of the
last few years. In consequence of the drought in 1905,
15,000 of the city and district, chiefly of the poorer
classes, migrated to Jaffa, Haifa, Acre, Nazareth,
Damascus and Egypt, owing to the exactions of the
Government, and the high rate of interest demanded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the Effendis to whom they were indebted. This exodus
is only a temporary misfortune.</p>

<p>The population of Gaza is said at one time to have
outnumbered that of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The road-tracks between Gaza, Jaffa, and Beersheba
are badly in need of repair. In places the sand is very
heavy, especially in the summer-time. A road tax is
levied, but no road has been improved for many years.</p>

<p>Gaza is in a state of lethargy for about nine months out
of twelve, until the middle of April, when the barley
crop is cut, because most of the inhabitants earn their
living by the barley trade. In consequence of much
idleness during this slack period, drunkenness is not an
uncommon vice. The wealthy merchants buy at harvest-time
large quantities of barley, which are generally exported
or stored, until the prices in Great Britain and
Egypt are high, when they sell to British and other
purchasers. The poorer traders pitch small tents in the
neighbourhood of the city, and among the Beduins, to
whom they sell clothes, sweets, coffee, and other articles,
taking barley in exchange. When they have secured a
sufficient amount, they sell it either to the agents of the
European merchants, or to the native merchants of the
city. Any one who visits Gaza in June and July will
be astonished to see the large quantities of barley heaped
upon the sea-shore, awaiting the arrival of steamers.</p>

<p>The building of the Government hospital, talked of
for so many years, has been begun, but it has, so far,
made little progress.</p>

<p>No banks are permanently established in Gaza. All
money transactions are carried on through the banks of
Jaffa.</p>

<p>There is a growing desire for male education. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
citizens, in September 1911, enthusiastically encouraged
a public performance of <i>Hamlet</i>, on behalf of a native
Muslim school. It was a first and successful attempt of
the kind.</p>

<p>Many Jews have been making inquiries with the view
of purchasing land in this district, and especially over
the boundary at Reifah.</p>

<p>Meyer says that during the Hellenistic period the Jews
resorted to the Gaza fairs. Frequent mention is made of
these fairs by Rabbinical authorities. In fact the fairs
at Gaza were always famed throughout Palestine.</p>

<p>Until the last seven years the numerous hordes of
100,000 Beduins within the Beersheba district were under
the government of Gaza. They swarm the desert towards
the south in the winter months, and then move northwards,
up the Philistia plain, for herbage.</p>

<p>Even in Christian families, until about thirty years
ago, slaves were sold in Gaza.</p>

<p>The cattle of Gaza are few, and there is scarcely any
export. Camels are common. They number approximately
6,700, including those of the surrounding villages
and Beduins. Sheep and goats number approximately
171,000, together with those of the near villages and
Beduins. Oxen number approximately 10,000 in and
around the city. They are chiefly used for ploughing.
Horses and mules and donkeys are not numerous, but
the former have an excellent reputation throughout
Palestine. Carriages usually belong to Jaffa, and carry
back in eleven hours passengers from Gaza. The first
motor-car, owned by a German from Jaffa, reached Gaza
during April 1912, accomplishing the journey in three
hours, and returning the same day.</p>

<p>Jackals and foxes are numerous. Quails arrive from
Egypt in July and August.</p>

GARDENS&mdash;OLIVE-GROVES&mdash;BIRDS, ETC.</h2>
</div>

<p>In January 1884, Mr. H. Chichester Hart visited
Gaza, and contributed a valuable paper to the <i>Quarterly
Statement</i> of the Palestine Exploration Fund, October
1885, entitled "A Naturalist's Journey to Sinai, Petra,
and Southern Palestine." From Chapter XI, Gaza to
Jaffa, I cull a few items of general interest&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gardens of fruit-trees, olive-groves, and enclosures,
hedged by the prickly pear, reached our camp from the
inland side. The trees at Gaza are chiefly date-palms,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
olives, sycamore-fig, carob or locust-tree, and fig; a very
handsome tamarisk reaches a height of thirty or forty
feet, and has light green foliage, very refreshing and
home-like after the dull grey or lifeless green of the
desert. The olives are of enormous age. They usually
have unbranched trunks, two or three feet in height,
then perhaps divided, and at seven or eight feet the leafy
canopy, browsed below to a level height by cattle, begins.
The average height of the tree is twenty to twenty-five or
thirty feet. Old trees have often mere shells of their
trunks remaining. I measured the two largest I saw, a
few miles north of Gaza; their girth was eighteen and
twenty feet respectively at two feet from the ground, a
size which was maintained, or very nearly so, till the
trunk forked."</p>

<p>Gaza is quite embowered in these great olive-groves,
which stretch north-eastwards the whole four miles to
Beit Hanûn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>These magnificent groves are the largest in Palestine.
They are said to have been planted by the Greeks, and
it is asserted that at all events since the coming of the
Saracens some seven hundred years back, not a single
new tree has been planted. Most of the trees stand on
huge roots, and have evidently sprung up from the
remains of former trunks rotted away.</p>

<p>Lentils are a common crop. Gaza trades with an
excellent quality of barley to Egypt. Consequently,
wealth increases, but the population, being still in a low
state of civilisation, live poorly. Even the well-to-do have
as a daily meal "fûl" (beans) with an onion, and a piece
of roughly ground barley bread. Meat is not wanted.</p>

<p>The luxuriance of the gardens and orchards, remarkable
for the scarlet blossoms of the pomegranates, and
the enormous oranges which gild the green foliage of
their groves, is due to the abundance of water, drawn
from twenty wells of fresh water bursting from the sandy
soil&mdash;some of them are not less that 150 feet deep.
The natives greatly prize the quality of the water. Good
water is, indeed, plentiful at greater or less depth over
all the district, even on the sea-shore, though the
frequency of rubble cisterns to the south and east show
that in ancient times the inhabitants depended largely on
artificial supply.</p>

<p>Gaza and Ascalon have always been noted for their
wells.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>In and about the Gaza olive-groves, several birds
familiar in Great Britain abound. There are English
sparrows, swallows, buntings, goldfinches, black redstarts,
chaffinches, stonechats, willow-wrens, chiff-chaffs, blackbirds,
and hooded crows. Other birds seen are Egyptian
kites, buzzards (common species), "boomey" or little
southern owl, red-breasted Cairo swallows, pelicans,
dunlins, calandra and crested larks, bulbuls, pied-chats,
and Menetrie's wheatear.</p>

<p>Frequently dogs with unmistakable traces of jackal
parentage are seen. It is by no means uncommon for
these vagrant animals to interbreed along this part of the
Mediterranean seaboard.</p>

<p>At the risk of some repetitions, I have gladly availed
myself of the opportunity of making use of a few details
published in the late Annual Reports by Mr. A. A.
Knesevich, H.B.M. Consular Agent at Gaza.</p>

<p>During my first visit to Gaza, in July 1891, my tent
was pitched in the Muslim cemetery, which stretches
over a wide space on the west of the city. The graves
are generally covered by a small erection of mud-brick,
plastered over and whitewashed. The cemetery is not
enclosed by any fence.</p>

HISTORY OF THE GAZA MISSION OF THE CHURCH
MISSIONARY SOCIETY (1878-1912)</h2>
</div>

<p>The Muslim city of Gaza (in Arabic <i>Chazzeh</i>) was
visited by the late Rev. F. A. Klein during a tour of
investigation in 1862.</p>

<p>Later on a pressing invitation was received from the
inhabitants to open a school in their midst.</p>

<p>A catechist was sent to make inquiries, but nothing
more was then done.</p>

<p>In 1878, however, the C.M.S. took over the four
schools, two for boys and two for girls, containing some
250 to 300 children, and other work which had been
started and carried on for several years by Mr. Pritchard,
a gentleman of independent means, who had settled in
Gaza. Shortly afterwards the Rev. A. W. Schapira
entered into residence. He opened a reading-room, which
attracted even higher-class Muslims.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a temporary opposition, the Kaimakam,
on Christmas Eve, 1880, addressed the gathering,
and encouraged the school.</p>

<p>Medical work was started about 1882, and was the first
C.M.S. work of the kind in Palestine.</p>

<p>The dispensary received a gift from the late Rev.
John Venn, of Hereford, and a fund was raised in
Salisbury Square for establishing a permanent medical
mission.</p>

<p>In 1886 the late Rev. Dr. R. Elliot took charge.</p>

<p>Dr. H. J. Bailey was also temporarily at this post in
1890, in order to assist in the medical work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>During this period Dr. Elliot had the joy of baptising,
on October 12, 1890, Moorjan and Mehbruki, two of
his own servants, man and wife, natives of the
Sudan.</p>

<p>Some years before they had been sold in Gaza as slaves,
the man for ten pounds, and the woman for twice that
sum. The slave market has been abolished for about
twenty years.</p>

<p>All this time the medical work was confined to the
treatment of out-patients, but in March 1891 a hospital
adapted from a native house was opened.</p>

<p>Medical itineration now began to be undertaken at
Mejdel and Ashdod. The fame of the hospital spread
far and wide.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Sterling (the author of <i>A Grammar of
the Arabic Language</i>, and <i>Arabic and English Idiom&mdash;Conversational
and Literary</i>) arrived in 1893, and his
predecessor, the Rev. J. Huber, of German nationality,
who built the ladies' house and church room, entered
into rest on July 18, and his body was buried in the
cemetery in the mission compound.</p>

<p>Other branches of the work have prospered. In 1902
the numbers in the girls' school rose from sixty-eight to
three hundred, and have now increased to four hundred.
The Sunday school has increased proportionately with
the day school. It would be difficult to find more
interesting schools in Palestine, so efficiently superintended
by Miss Smithies, who is ably assisted by her
own trained staff of native teachers.</p>

<p>In 1906 the Muslims presented Dr. Sterling, on
behalf of the building fund of the hospital, with £100,
which they had subscribed in token of their gratitude for
his work among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The leavening influence of Christian teaching is
unquestionably having far-reaching effects.</p>

<p>Dr. Percy W. Brigstocke was appointed, in 1907, to
act as colleague with Dr. Sterling, but he was transferred
to Es Salt at the end of 1911.</p>

<p>The old hospital and out-patient hall were insanitary,
and much too small for the work, therefore it was with
thankfulness that the Bishop in Jerusalem dedicated the
new hospital, containing forty-six beds, on April 1, 1908.</p>

<p>The opening of the spacious out-patient block took
place on February 22, 1911.</p>

<p>The patients are drawn from all classes, Muslims,
Orthodox Syrians and Jews. They may be seen sitting
side by side in the out-patient hall waiting for the doctor,
who is an accomplished Arabic scholar.</p>

<p>During 1912 there were 29,581 attendances of out-patients,
701 in-patients, 452 visits in town, and 411
major operations.</p>

<p>The fees from the in-patients and out-patients during
1912 amounted to £326 18<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, which goes to assist
in the upkeep of the hospital.</p>

<p>There is an out-station, for the expenses of which Dr.
Sterling is responsible, at El Arîsh, the ancient Rhinocolura,
"the River of Egypt" (Numbers xxxiv. 5; Isaiah
xxvii. 12), a town of twelve hours' ride from Gaza, where
the C.M.S. school has had an average attendance of
fifty pupils. The population is entirely Muslim.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Watson, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, has done
heroic service not only by inspiring others to give and
help the completion of the hospital and out-buildings, but
also in attending personally to the purchasing of much
building and furnishing material.</p>

<p>How much Gaza owes to him and his Northumbrian
helpers will only appear when the great audit of all things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
takes place.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Canon Sterling is largely his own clerk of the works.
He is to be congratulated that after twenty years of
missionary and medical work in Southern Palestine, he
has been enabled to complete the group of medical
and educational buildings which now adorn the C.M.S.
Gaza compound.</p>

It may not be generally known that General Gordon paid two
visits to Gaza in 1883. On the first occasion he spent a fortnight,
and afterwards three weeks in the C.M.S. compound. An interesting
relic is the iron bedstead on which he slept. It is still associated
with his name, and is being carefully preserved.</p></div>

EL ARÎSH AND C.M.S. MISSION</h2>


<p>The border town of Egypt, El Arîsh, seventy miles
south of Gaza, is generally identified as the "River of
Egypt," which was the most southern boundary of the
Holy Land in patriarchal times. At present the actual
boundary between Palestine and Egypt is a line running
from Rafah, the ancient Rhaphia, some thirty miles to the
north of El Arîsh, to Akaba.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The country between Rafah and El Arîsh is desolate.
The large sand dunes, the dust of ages, have encroached
upon the land, whereas the Land of Promise may be
recognised by its fertility. Around the villages which
lie between Gaza and Rafah are orchards which produce
an abundance of fruit; the fig, vine, pomegranate,
almond, olive, apricot, date, mulberry, palm, apple,
orange, and banana, are all grown, besides vegetables
of all kinds, of a size rarely met with in Great Britain.</p>

<p>El Arîsh, the ancient Rhinocolura, the chief town of
the Sinai Peninsula, possesses some eight thousand inhabitants.
The "River of Egypt," so called, is conspicuous
by its absence, except in the rainy season,
when a large portion of the water from the peninsula
courses through its bed to the sea. The river-bed is
very wide, and many hundreds of poplar trees are
scattered over it, with numerous wells for irrigation.</p>

<p>The most striking building is the Government Fort. It
is some five hundred years old, and bears evidence of
attacks made by invaders.</p>

<p>Owing to the barrenness of the land the people are
exempted from all taxation. Some five thousand camels
are owned by these Sawârikeh Beduins, and these "ships
of the desert" do much of the carrying trade between
Egypt and Syria, and in Egypt itself during the cotton
season.</p>

<p>The people are exclusively Muslims, with the exception
of two Coptic officials. The town is beautifully clean.</p>

<p>There is here a magnificent field for missionary
enterprise. No mission work of any kind had ever been
attempted in the town until Dr. Sterling opened a boys'
school in 1906.</p>

<p>The people are friendly, and come to the hospital at
Gaza in goodly numbers.</p>

<p>In 1908 Dr. Sterling was able to purchase a beautiful
site of four and a half acres. A native master from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Gaza, M. Nasri, and pupil teacher, are now at work in a
school attended by sixty or seventy scholars. This
school is dependent upon voluntary help, and Mr. W.
Watson and Dr. Sterling are responsible for its maintenance.</p>

<p>Not only is Holy Scripture taught, but the master has
many opportunities of bearing witness to the truths of
Christianity.</p>

<p>This station ought to be properly supported, and can
be more easily worked from Gaza than from Egypt.</p>

<p>Dr. Sterling has the plans for building schools for boys
and girls, a teachers' house, a house for dispensary
attached for two English ladies, preferably one an
educationalist and the other a nurse. At present there
is only money in hand for the proposed girls' school.</p>

<span class="smcap">Public Games at Gaza</span><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Periodical games were often closely connected with
the religious rites. The great importance of public games
in Imperial times is well known. Not a provincial town
of any consequence was without them. This was
especially the case with those in connection with the
games in honour of the Emperor, which were everywhere
in vogue, even in the time of Augustus.</p>

<p>In Gaza a πανήγυρις Ἁδριανή (an assembly of a whole
nation for a public festival) was celebrated from the
time of Hadrian. A παγκράτιον (the joint contest which
comprises both wrestling and boxing) is mentioned as
held there in the inscription of Aphrodisias. These
wrestlers and boxers of Gaza were, in the fourth
century, the most famous in Syria. St. Jerome, in his
<i>Life of St. Hilarion</i>, mentions the Circensian games
there.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Pharisaic Judaism has always repudiated this heathen
kind of games (1 Maccabees i. 14, 15; 2 Maccabees iv.
9-17).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Judaism, however, was unable, in spite of this
theoretic repudiation, to prevent the pageantry of
heathen games from developing every fourth year, in
the midst of the Holy Land, during and after the
Herodian period.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Circus of Gaza</span><a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></h3>

<p>Moonrise on the desert. Above the dark ridges of
rocks which rose from the tawny waste of sand, a pale
faint light poured down on the wilderness of Gaza. An
aged man, yet apparently more worn with labour than
with years, was standing at the entrance of a cave,
which, dark and silent, pierced one of the mountain
ridges.</p>

<p>The time of which I am speaking was about 350 years
after the birth of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>; the place was one of the
deserts which stretched themselves between the Nile and
the Holy Land. Already innumerable hosts of monks
occupied the wilderness of Egypt; and if St. Antony had
attained the greatest reputation for the holiness of his
life and the wonders of his miracles, St. Hilarion among
the monks of the solitudes held the second place. Many
times he had fled from the concourse of people that the
fame of his powers of healing had drawn to him; and
now, in one of the wildest and most unfrequented parts
of the wilderness, he hoped to find a place where he
might serve <span class="smcap">God</span> without the interruption of men.</p>

<p>The moonlight showed distinctly the furthest objects
on the horizon; and as the hermit stood gazing around
him, and thinking, perhaps, of that new heaven and new
earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, which shall be the
abode of those who have been <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> faithful servants
here, he noticed a dark spot in the far distance, which
gradually drew nearer, and took form and shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Half-an-hour brought to the entrance of his cave a
large company of Christians. Camels there were to
carry those who were of rank to need such a conveyance,
and attendants and slaves in abundance. For already,
in part, the kingdoms of this world were become the
kingdoms of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and of His <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; and to be a
Christian was no longer, as fifty years before it had been,
a badge of infamy; although in the south-western part of
Palestine the worshippers of idols still outnumbered the
holders of the true faith.</p>

<p>"Are we happy enough," said one of them who
arrived first, a tall and somewhat portly man, who had
just descended from his camel before speaking; "are we
happy enough to stand in the presence of Hilarion, of
whose fame all Egypt and Palestine are full?"</p>

<p>"My name is Hilarion, my son," said the hermit;
"and if ye seek anything with so miserable a sinner as
myself, I am ready, <span class="smcap">God</span> helping, to assist you so far
as may lie in my power, He enabling me."</p>

<p>"Well, then, this is the case," said the stranger. "I
am a citizen of Gaza; my name is Italicus; and I come to
you for that which may much assist in promoting the
glory of Him that is our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> and <span class="smcap">Saviour</span>."</p>

<p>"If it be to His glory, my son," said Hilarion, "ask
what you will, and in His Name I promise to fulfil, so
far as I may, your desires."</p>

<p>"I will tell you, holy father," said Italicus. "It is
the custom of our city that the two most wealthy inhabitants
should try the speed of their horses against
each other in the circus. Now, for this year I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
appointed to exhibit these races on the one side, and
Ælius Flaccus, who is a worshipper of idols, on the
other. He has dedicated his horses and his chariots to
the ancient idol of the city, Marnas, and he boasts that
no Christian can conquer those which have been so
consecrated. All our fellow-citizens know me to be a
Christian; they know that I put my only trust in our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> whom the Gentiles blaspheme; and they know
also that the horses of Flaccus are the best breed in the
country, and that mine, although I have done my best,
are inferior, and give no promise of victory. Wherefore
I have betaken myself to you, holy father, to entreat
you to assist me, if it may so be, in this great strait."</p>

<p>"And are you not ashamed," said Hilarion, "to trouble
a servant of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> with matters such as these? Why
not, rather, sell your miserable horses, and give the
price of them to the poor? according to that saying,
'Sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven.'"</p>

<p>"But, my father," returned Italicus, "you must consider
that this office is none of my seeking; it is thrust
upon me by the laws of the city. I desire not victory
for mine own honour; but the heathen look upon this
race as a trial between Marnas and the <span class="smcap">God</span> whom the
Christians worship. It is for <span class="smcap">Christ's</span> sake, not for
mine, that I desire the victory."</p>

<p>"Is this so?" inquired Hilarion, looking round on the
little company that had gathered about him.</p>

<p>"It is so," said an old Christian, stepping forward from
the rest. "It is no vainglory that brings us hither; we
who have seen the true glory of the martyrs of Palestine,
who by divers torments rendered up their most blessed
souls to <span class="smcap">God</span>. It is as Italicus says. The horses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Flaccus are dedicated to Marnas; they are the fleetest
that the whole province of Palestine can show; those of
Italicus, though he has done his best, cannot be compared
to them; and yet the voice of the people has
consecrated them to the <span class="smcap">God</span> whom we worship. For
any common victory we should not have sought assistance
from you; as it is, we do not think that we are
preferring an unworthy request. If Flaccus wins,
Marnas conquers also; if Italicus is first in the race, then,
as the multitude will deem, the <span class="smcap">Lord Christ</span> will show
Himself to be superior to the idols of the heathen."</p>

<p>"It is a hard case," said Hilarion, "when such rivalships
find place. Nevertheless we must not quench the
smoking flax. All that a Christian man may lawfully
do to destroy the works of the devil, that it is the bounden
duty of Italicus, and of myself, and of every one that
bears the name of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, to take in hand. Wherefore
bring me a bowl of water."</p>

<p>One of the attendants ran to the little stream by which
the hermit had taken up his abode, filled a vessel, and
brought it to him. He made the sign of the cross over
it and drank.</p>

<p>"Now, my son," he said to Italicus, "take this water
and sprinkle your horses, and their manger, and their
stable therewith. Thus you shall find in the day of trial,
that the meanest of <span class="smcap">God's</span> servants, even though he be
like myself, has power to confound the idol Marnas, and
all his priests, and all his worshippers."</p>

<p>Thankfully and carefully Italicus received the water;
and after expressing his gratitude to the hermit, he and
his company returned over the desert towards Gaza.</p>

<p>Now we will pass over ten days.</p>

<p>A bright spring morning shone over the ancient city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the Philistines. Here and there the white marble temples
of Jupiter, and of Minerva, and of Apollo, glittered in all
the beauty of their pillars, and their friezes, and their
bas-reliefs. But high above the rest, and more sumptuous
than all, glowed that of the god Marnas, the idol
whom the inhabitants of Gaza delighted to honour. Had
you stood by the great door of his temple, you might
have seen a crowd of worshippers and a little company
of priests offering their sacrifices, and praying that
he would be pleased to prosper his own worshippers
on his own day; that he would give fleetness to their
horses; and that he would assist in rooting out the
execrable sect of the Nazarenes and their crucified <span class="smcap">God</span>
from the face of the earth. The oxen were garlanded
with flowers, the altars were wreathed with laurel, and
the augurs were taking omens as to the success of the
contest. The laurel leaves when cast into the fire gave
a good omen; the chickens when fed at their troughs
promised victory; and from the large size of the heart
in one of the sacrificed beasts, the soothsayers drew the
conclusion that the god had bid Ælius Flaccus to be of
good courage.</p>

<p>The report had spread through the city that Hilarion
the wonder-worker had interested himself in the success
of the Christian. Half-an-hour before midday crowds
were flocking to the circus; the pagans, who were of the
Red faction, wearing badges of that colour, and outnumbering
their opponents, who were of the Green party,
six or seven to one. They flocked in through the various
doors of the circus; the officers whose duty it was
marshalled the way for the more influential citizens;
the poor locarii, who had come early to take the best
places, sold them at the best bargain they could to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
wealthier spectators; and so great was the interest in a
contest, not so much between Italicus and Flaccus as
between Marnas and the <span class="smcap">God</span> of the Christians, that
never had so brisk a trade been driven in the letting and
underletting of seats as on that day.</p>

<p>I have many times described to you the amphitheatres
as they were in that age. Now I will tell you what the
circus was like; and attend, or you will not understand
the story.</p>

<p>Imagine a long oval space of ground, a quarter of a
mile in length, and surrounded with seats, rising in tiers,
one above the other, the lowest of stone and the highest
of wood; these tiers of seats were divided by narrow
passages called <i>vomitories</i>, which gave entrance to the
spectators. At one end of the enclosed space was a
wooden erection, containing a series of wooden seats, or
rather boxes, handsomely curtained and cushioned, for
the use of the magistrates. As it is not yet the hour of
the race we shall be able, as we enter, to examine the
place without disturbance. This spot, immediately in
front of the magistrates' seats, is the starting-place for
the chariots; they call it the <i>carceres</i>; in front of it, you
see, are four images of Mercury, with chains stretched
from one to the other, behind which the horses will
presently be stationed; the men standing by them, two
of the Red, two of the Green faction, are called the
<i>moratores</i>; their business is to see that it is a fair start.
From the carceres, as you will observe, there runs
almost to the other end of the circus a very broad brick
wall, some three feet high, and twelve in thickness; at
both ends of this are three little pyramids, which they
call <i>metæ</i>; the wall itself they name the <i>spina</i>. The
horses, then, starting from the carcer, under the magistrates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
run seven times round the spina, going in what
seems to us a very unnatural fashion, from left to right.
In order that there may be no mistake, that man who is
leaning idly against the spina, and chatting with one of
moratores, has it in charge to set up a little wooden
obelisk close to the carcer&mdash;you will see the sockets in
the ground&mdash;for each turn that the chariots make.
Thus, when the Red horses have made one circle, he
will erect a red obelisk; when the Green ones have done
the same, a green one, and so on.</p>

<p>Now all the seats are so full that it seems impossible
for more spectators to be accommodated; nevertheless,
still they come pouring in. It is not only from Gaza and
the neighbouring country that they are flocking, but from
Joppa, from Cæsarea, and even from Ælia Capitolina&mdash;as
they now call Jerusalem&mdash;many of its inhabitants are
come up to these games. The priests of Marnas will
feast for many a day on the proceeds of this; and if it
should so happen that the horses of Marnas conquer,
his worshippers will say, what King Darius said to
another idol, "Great art thou, O Bel, and there is no
deceit in thee!" As to Didymus the Christian priest,
he had at first held back from expressing any interest in
the matter; but when he was told that Hilarion had
consented to assist Italicus, he encouraged to the best of
his powers the Christian candidate, and though he would
not himself attend the games, he awaited the result in his
own house with no small anxiety.</p>

<p>Now the magistrates are taking their places in their
robes of office. He in the centre, who has just taken
his seat in that projecting balcony, is Asinius Gallus,
edile of the place; a noted favourer of the old religion,
and the great friend of Flaccus. Next to him are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
principal magistrates of some of the neighbouring towns;
and on each side of them, the inferior officials of Gaza
itself. There also are Italicus and Ælius Flaccus; but
of the twenty or thirty persons who thus occupy the
seats of honour, not more than three are of the Green
faction.</p>

<p>Presently, the doors under the balcony occupied by
the magistrates, and opening on the hither end of the
circus, are thrown open; and the chariots and horses
enter. The moratores cast lots for the respective position
of each. For, as you will see, the chariot that was on
the left, or, as we should now call it, the near side, had
the disadvantage of being compelled to make a larger
circle each time; this was, however, a little made up for
by the danger that the chariot on the off side experienced
in rounding the metæ at the end. They cast two pieces
of ivory into a bowl, and shook them; that which bore
the name of Flaccus first leaped out; his morator had
therefore the choice of ground; and his chariot took the
right-hand place.</p>

<p>These chariots, as you see, have only two wheels, are
low, have the front part bulging out in a circle, and are
entirely open behind; they are intended only to carry
one man. As that of Ælius Flaccus takes up its position,
the Red faction through the circus rise, clap their hands,
stamp with their feet, and cheer. And well they may;
for every one agrees that finer animals than the three
black horses yoked abreast which draw it were never
seen in Gaza. There is also some applause bestowed on
the three bay horses of Italicus, but poor and faint indeed,
as compared with the thunder that had greeted the
other. As you may well imagine, their master has carefully
observed the directions of Hilarion; horses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
manger and provender have been sprinkled with the
water; and Italicus himself entertains not the least doubt
of success; though the edile of Joppa has just offered to
him of Lydda an even bet that the red chariot will have
finished its seventh course before the green has reached
the meta which will form its sixth and a half. Now,
silence; for Asinius Gallus is about to speak. His voice
can only be heard down a short space of that enormous
length; but the purport of what he says is soon passed
on to its very extremity.</p>

<p>"Good men and true,"&mdash;such are his words&mdash;"it is
well known to all that this city of Gaza has been for now
many hundred years a worshipper of the great god
Marnas, and that we, the larger part of its citizens, still
cleave to the religion of our forefathers. It is also well
known to all that, as elsewhere throughout the world, so
here more especially, there are not wanting those who
ridicule our faith, they themselves worshipping One that
was crucified in this land, more than three hundred years
ago. These games, therefore, which we are this day
met to celebrate, have more than the common interest
that in other years we have taken in them. Our worthy
fellow-citizen, Ælius Flaccus, has dedicated his horses to
Marnas, and the soothsayers have assured him of victory.
His rival, who follows the faith of the emperors, Junius
Italicus, has in like manner sought the assistance of his
<span class="smcap">God</span>, and has availed himself of I know not what incantations
performed by one of the savage and brutish
race of men now beginning to people the wilderness to
the south. Thus this day will be made manifest which
of these two gods can best hear the prayers of his
servant. As a magistrate of this city, I am bound to
judge and decide impartially; but as a believer in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
ancient faith, I am not ashamed to express my hope
that Marnas will vindicate his honour by giving the
victory to his worshipper. And this, men of Gaza, I
know to be your wish as well as my own; the soothsayers
have given us the promise of success; our god
himself is on our side; and the prayers of all that have
the ancient fame of Gaza at heart will be joined with
mine that Ælius Flaccus may prove the victor in this
race."</p>

<p>The people, of course, applauded loudly; and Asinius
Gallus resumed his seat. Immediately, the moratores
disengaged the chains from the images of Mercury; the
drivers grasped their reins and their whips; deep silence
fell upon the multitude; and the edile again stood up,
and gave the white napkin, which was the signal for the
start, to the official whose business it was to make the
sign. He then, mounting on the spina, stood a little
before the two chariots, holding the linen in his hand,
and keeping his eyes fixed on Asinius Gallus. The
magistrate, after having cast his eyes right and left to
see that his brother functionaries were comfortably
settled, and ready to look on at their ease, nodded to the
officer; the napkin fell; and the chariots started.</p>

<p>Inferior as were the horses of Italicus to those of his
opponent, the spectators had imagined that for the first
three or four courses round the circus the race would be
closely contested. But scarcely had a minute elapsed,
when the green chariot, surrounded by whirlwinds of
dust, was already half-way to the further meta, while
that which had been dedicated to Marnas, in spite of the
vociferations and lashings of the driver, was lagging far
behind. Those at the further end of the circus fancied
that its driver, secure in the excellence of his horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
had given his rival a long start, in order to make his own
victory the more triumphant. But those who could see
better were not so deceived. Flaccus and the edile
interchanged glances of astonishment and vexation; one
or two of the other magistrates whispered to each other
that it must be witchcraft; it was in vain that the Reds
shouted, clapped their hands, and endeavoured to encourage
the charioteer; vast majority as they were, their
voices were drowned in the thunder of applause which
welcomed the green chariot as it now flew towards the
carceres, having made one circle, while the other had
scarcely yet turned the meta at the further end. Up
went the green obelisk; and the Christian chariot started
on its second course. It was in vain that Ælius Flaccus
stamped with rage, ground his teeth, and shook his fist
at his own unfortunate driver, now creeping up towards
the magistrates' seat. As of old time, the chariot drave
heavily; and even from some of the Red faction there
burst forth a shout of "Marnas is conquered!" But
when the green chariot, now making its fifth round,
passed its rival which had not yet completed its fourth,
such a thunder of applause echoed through the circus as
Gaza had never heard before&mdash;unless it might be when,
some fifteen hundred years further back, Samson had
made sport for the lords of the Philistines on the roof
of the temple of Marnas, then better known by his other
name of Dagon. The priests of the idol will do well to
treasure up the offerings they have received to-day; for,
depend upon it, they will never have any more. I can
already hear some words that sound exceedingly like
"Impostor!" in the mouths of their adherents; and
now that the green chariot comes bounding along to the
conclusion of its final course, and its driver throws his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
reins into the hands of the morator, and leaps, well
pleased, to the ground, and it is evident to all that the
horses are not distressed, and have scarcely even turned
a hair, while those of Marnas are labouring at the further
end of the circus, and have its full length to traverse
before they finish their sixth course&mdash;now I say, that
the idol has been utterly confounded, and the faith of
one poor hermit has triumphed over all the charms of a
college of pagan priests, the shout that bursts from every
part of the benches seems to me to ring the death knell
of idolatry in Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

DESTRUCTION OF THE EIGHT HEATHEN TEMPLES OF GAZA
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 401)</h2>
</div>

<p>During the Episcopate of St. Porphyrius, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 395-420,
there were eight State-property temples in the city
of Gaza: (1) Helios&mdash;the Sun; (2) Aphroditus&mdash;Venus;
(3) Apollo; (4) Persephone; (5) Hecate; (6) the Hiereion
(or Heroon); (7) the Tychæon; (8) the Marneion.</p>

<p>Their names imply that purely Greek worship prevailed
in them.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Temple of the Sun.</span>&mdash;In Greek mythology
the sun-god, son of the Titan Hyperion and the
Titaness Theia, is himself often called Hyperion.</p>

<p>Helios was worshipped in many places. The Island
of Rhodes was entirely consecrated to him. The worship
of this sun-god was with great difficulty eventually
suppressed by substituting for him the prophet Ἡλίας.
In modern times Helios seems to be identified with St.
Elias, whose chapels are built chiefly on hill-tops.</p>

<p>It was this particular worship to which the Antonines
showed special favour. The name of Antoninus Pius is
connected with the building of the Temple of the Sun
at Baalbec.</p>

<p>The late Lieut. Conder wrote an interesting article
on "Sun Worship in Syria," in the <i>Quarterly Statement</i>
of the P. E. F., April 1881, pp. 80-4. Prof. Sayce, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<i>Patriarchal Palestine</i>, p. 218, ed. 1912, states that with
both the Semites of Babylonia and of Canaan the supreme
object of worship was Baal or Bel, "the Lord," who
was but the Sun-god under a variety of names.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Aphrodite</span> (called <i>Venus</i> by the Romans).</p>

<p>In Greek, the goddess of love and beauty.</p>

<p>The worship of the Phœnician goddess Astarte,
brought in by Phœnician traders in early days, helped
to form the conception which the Greeks had of Aphrodite.</p>

<p>A Sanctuary of Aphrodite (Astarte) stood on the place
where, according to Christian tradition, was the Sepulchre
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.</p>

<p>A chief worship of Ascalon was that of Ἀφροδίτη Οὐρανία,
<i>i.e.</i> of Astarte, as Queen of Heaven. Herodotus mentions
her as the deity of Ascalon.</p>

<p>This female deity is represented on coins of the
Imperial epoch chiefly as the tutelary goddess of the City.</p>

<p>As goddess of the <i>sea</i>, and maritime traffic, especially
of calm seas, and prosperous voyages, she was widely
worshipped by sailors and fishermen as the goddess of
<i>calm</i>.</p>

<p>Her influence was also felt in the gardens among the
flowers in the spring-time. It was then that her principal
festivals occurred.</p>

<p>A chief seat of her worship was Cyprus.</p>

<p>Additional information on this independent, unmarried
goddess is to be found in Sayce's <i>Patriarchal Palestine</i>,
pp. 218-21.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Apollo</span> (Greek Ἀπόλλων), son of Zeus and Leto,
brother of Artemis, portrayed with flowing hair, as ever
being young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Apollo appears originally as a god of <i>light</i>. As the god
of spiritual light, his festivals are all in spring and
summer. He is one of the great gods of the Greeks, and
next to Zeus the most widely worshipped.</p>

<p>Josephus speaks of a Temple of Apollo at Gaza, 96
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (<i>Antiq.</i>, xiii. 13, 3), at the time when the city fell into
the hands of Alexander Jannæus. "The Senators, who
were in all five hundred, fled to Apollo's Temple (for this
attack happened to be made as they were sitting), whom
Alexander slew."</p>

<p>The worship of Apollo is to be traced to Seleucid
influence, for Apollo was the ancestral god of the
Seleucids, and a great favourite with them.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Persephone</span> (Latin Proserpina), daughter of Zeus
and the earth-goddess Demeter, the goddess of the lower
world.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Her special name in Attic cult is <span class="smcap">Corê</span>, lit. "the
maiden."</p>

<p>Persephone is emblematic of vegetable life that comes
and goes with the changing seasons.</p>

<p>Her festivals were celebrated in spring, and after the
harvest.</p>

<p>The pomegranate was Proserpine's symbol, and the
pigeon and the cock were sacred to her.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Hecate</span>, a Greek moon-goddess, perhaps of non-Hellenic
origin. Her appearance is frightful. She is
generally represented as a daughter of Perses.</p>

<p>As a goddess of the lower world she was the patroness
of all enchanters and enchantresses, who were her
disciples and protegés.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Heroon. The Hiereion.</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p>Heroon is the shrine of a hero, from ἥρως, a hero.
Hesiod reserves this name for mortals of divine origin,
who are therefore also known as demigods.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">The Tyche</span>, identified with the Roman Fortuna.
A female deity&mdash;the daughter of Zeus. She was of more
importance in Italy than among the Greeks.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology she was originally the goddess of
chance. In the course of time she came to be extensively
worshipped as a goddess of prosperity, who had
cities under her special protection.</p>

<p>Meyer (pp. 122 and 158), refers to the Tyche as a
familiar figure upon Gazæan coins, having a woman's
head, with a turreted crown consisting of three towers,
one of which is pierced with a door, and with a veil over
the back of her head.</p>

<p>The reverse side of the coin of Antoninus in Plate XI,
No. 7, of De Saulcy's <i>Numismatique de la Palestine</i>,
is a good representation of the Gaza Tyche.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">The Marneion.</span></p>

<p>The Temple of Marnas is spoken of as the Marneion,
a home of the city's god.</p>

<p>Marnas was the Baal of Gaza.</p>

<p>In the Roman period Marnas was the chief deity of
the city. St. Jerome mentions this Temple of Marnas.</p>

<p>The oldest express testimony of the cult of Marnas is,
according to De Saulcy, that of certain coins of Hadrian,
with the superscription <span class="smcap">Gaza Marna</span>.</p>

<p>"In the last days of paganism, as we learn from
Marcus Diaconus, in his <i>Life of Porphyry of Gaza</i>, this
great god of Gaza was regarded as the god of rains, and
invoked against famine. That Marnas was lineally
descended from Dagon is probable in every way, and it
is therefore interesting to note that he gave oracles, that
he had a circular temple, where he was sometimes worshipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
by human sacrifices, that there were twenty wells
in the sacred circuit, and that there was also a place of
adoration to him, situated, in old Semitic fashion, outside
the town."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>This temple outside the town was possibly the place
called Bethelia, one and three-quarter miles north of
Gaza.</p>
